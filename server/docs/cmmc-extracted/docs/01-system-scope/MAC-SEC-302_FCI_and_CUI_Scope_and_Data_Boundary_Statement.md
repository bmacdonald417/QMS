# FCI and CUI Scope and Data Boundary Statement - CMMC Level 2

**Document Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-30  
**Classification:** Internal Use  
**Compliance Framework:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced)  
**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2

**Applies to:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (FCI and CUI system)

**Note:** This document has been upgraded from Level 1 to Level 2. FCI scope statements remain valid. CUI scope added per Level 2 requirements.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document explicitly defines the scope of Federal Contract Information (FCI) handled by the MacTech Solutions system and establishes definitive boundaries to prevent unauthorized data types from entering the system. This statement addresses assessor concerns regarding FCI boundary enforcement and data type restrictions.

---

## 2. Federal Contract Information (FCI) Definition

**FCI Definition (FAR 52.204-21):**
Federal Contract Information (FCI) means information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information that is lawfully publicly available without restrictions.

**MacTech Solutions FCI Scope:**
Only non-public information related to government contracts is treated as FCI. Publicly released information (e.g., SAM.gov postings, USAspending.gov data) is not FCI unless combined with internal, non-public data.

The system handles:
- Non-public contract opportunity data received, generated, or stored internally
- Internal analysis, annotations, and derived data related to contract opportunities
- User-generated content that combines public data with internal, non-public information

**Important Note:** Publicly available data from SAM.gov and USAspending.gov APIs is not FCI by itself. FCI exists only when such data is combined with internal, non-public information or when the system receives, generates, or stores non-public contract-related information.

---

## 3. Restricted Data Types and Handling Rules

The following data types have explicit handling rules to prevent scope creep and to ensure data types are processed only within the approved boundary and controls.

### 3.1 Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- **Status:** **In-scope** for CMMC Level 2 and handled only through the approved CUI flow.
- **Approved handling:** CUI file bytes are handled only within the **CUI Vault cryptographic boundary** (<vault-domain>). hosting provider (historical) does not store or proxy CUI bytes.
- **CUI workspace:** A dedicated **endpoint operating system VM** serves as the **primary CUI workspace** (controlled endpoint). The browser on this workstation performs direct-to-vault upload/view.
- **Boundary rule:** Any system/component not explicitly designated for CUI handling is prohibited from receiving/storing CUI bytes.
- **Enforcement:** Direct-to-vault upload/view, non-CUI upload rejection, access control, MFA, and audit logging (see Sections 4 and 5).

### 3.2 Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- **Prohibition:** PII that is not part of publicly available FCI is prohibited
- **Scope:** Information that can be used to identify an individual
- **Exception:** PII that is part of publicly available contract opportunity data (e.g., contracting officer names in solicitations)

### 3.3 Classified Information
- **Prohibition:** All classified information (Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) is prohibited
- **Scope:** Any information marked or designated as classified

### 3.4 Other Prohibited Data
- Proprietary information not related to contract opportunities
- Trade secrets
- Health information (HIPAA-protected)
- Financial information (beyond publicly available contract values)
- Any data not directly related to federal contract opportunity management

## 4. Technical and Procedural Enforcement

### 4.1 Technical Controls

**Current Implementation:**
- CUI file bytes are never accepted by hosting provider (historical); uploads and downloads are direct-to-vault only
- hosting provider (historical) endpoints accept metadata and issue short-lived tokens (`/api/cui/upload-session`, `/api/cui/view-session`, `/api/cui/record`)
- CUI keyword monitoring is used to **block CUI** on `/api/files/upload` and log detection
- Database schema stores FCI data and CUI metadata only (no CUI content in hosting provider (historical) DB)

**Technical Enforcement:**
- **CUI Uploads:** `/api/files/upload` rejects CUI multipart with 400 and instructs direct-to-vault upload. CUI bytes never transit hosting provider (historical).
- **CUI Keyword Monitoring:** `detectCUIKeywords()` used to identify and block CUI on non-CUI upload path; detection may be logged as monitoring event.
- **CUI Boundary Enforcement:** Upload and view tokens are issued via hosting provider (historical); CUI bytes flow directly between browser and vault.
- **Code References:**
  - CUI detection: `lib/cui-blocker.ts`
  - Upload session: `app/api/cui/upload-session/route.ts`
  - View session: `app/api/cui/view-session/route.ts`
  - Metadata record: `app/api/cui/record/route.ts`
  - Upload rejection: `app/api/files/upload/route.ts`

**Technical Enforcement Evidence:** See `05-evidence/MAC-RPT-101_CUI_Blocking_Technical_Controls_Evidence.md` and `docs/CUI_VAULT_API_CONTRACT.md` for direct-to-vault flow and boundary enforcement.

**Boundary Statement:** The system processes CUI only within the vault boundary. hosting provider (historical) terminates TLS for metadata and token issuance only, not for CUI bytes. This enforcement combines technical controls (direct-to-vault, upload rejection), procedural controls (user training), and monitoring (spill detection).

### 4.2 Procedural Controls

**User Acknowledgment:**
- All users must sign the User Access and FCI/CUI Handling Acknowledgement before system access.
- Acknowledgment covers handling responsibilities for FCI and CUI, including endpoint handling expectations (use of the approved endpoint operating system CUI workspace, no uncontrolled dissemination, reporting of spills, and use of approved upload/view mechanisms).

**Contractual / Policy Requirements:**
- User agreements and policies require CUI to be handled only through approved system mechanisms and prohibit unauthorized disclosure or storage outside the approved boundary.
- Violations may result in access revocation and incident response actions.

**Administrative Oversight:**
- System administrators monitor for unauthorized data types
- Regular review of stored data for compliance

**Evidence:** See `MAC-FRM-203_User_Access_and_FCI_Handling_Acknowledgement.md`

## 5. Data Boundary Enforcement

### 5.1 System Boundary

**In-Scope Data:**
- FCI as defined in Section 2
- System metadata (user accounts, audit logs)
- CUI metadata and vault references required for access control and auditing
- CUI file bytes handled within the CUI Vault boundary (encrypted at rest; TLS in transit)

**Out-of-Scope Data:**
- PII beyond publicly available FCI (prohibited)
- Classified information (prohibited)

### 5.2 Enforcement Mechanisms

**Prevention:**
- User training and acknowledgment
- Procedural controls
- Administrative oversight

**Detection:**
- Administrative review of stored data
- User reporting mechanisms

**Response:**
- Immediate access revocation for violations
- Data removal if prohibited data is detected
- Incident reporting procedures

---

## 6. Derived Data Considerations

**Statement:** The system processes FCI to generate derived data (scores, analysis, recommendations). All derived data remains within the FCI boundary and is subject to the same protections as source FCI.

**Prohibition:** Users are prohibited from combining FCI with external data sources in a manner that would create CUI or classified information.

## 7. Leadership Attestation

### 7.1 Attestation Statement

I, the undersigned authorized official, attest that:

1. The MacTech Solutions system is designed and operated to handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) consistent with CMMC Level 2 requirements.

2. CUI file bytes are handled only within the approved CUI Vault cryptographic boundary and approved direct-to-vault workflows. The main application (hosting provider (historical)) does not store or proxy CUI file bytes and stores metadata only.

3. The system prohibits processing/storage/transmission of prohibited data types (e.g., classified information, prohibited PII) and enforces these prohibitions through technical controls, policies, and monitoring.

4. Procedural controls are in place to prevent unauthorized data types from entering the system.

5. The organization will take immediate action to remove prohibited data if detected, execute incident response procedures as required, and revoke access for users who violate handling rules.

6. This statement is accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.
