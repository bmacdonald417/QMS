**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 3.3 Sanitize Equipment for Off-Site Maintenance (3.7.3)

**Requirement:** Ensure equipment removed for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI.

**Implementation:**
- System is cloud-based (no equipment removed for maintenance)
- No customer-managed equipment requiring off-site maintenance
- Equipment sanitization not applicable to system architecture

**Evidence:**
- System architecture: Cloud-based, no customer equipment

**Status:** 🚫 Not Applicable (cloud-only system, no equipment removal)

---

### 3.4 Check Maintenance Media (3.7.4)

**Requirement:** Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in organizational systems.

**Implementation:**
- System is cloud-based (no diagnostic media used)
- Maintenance performed via platform tools (no external media)
- Media checking not applicable to system architecture

**Evidence:**
- System architecture: Cloud-based maintenance

**Status:** 🚫 Not Applicable (cloud-only system, no diagnostic media)

---

### 3.5 MFA for Nonlocal Maintenance (3.7.5)

**Requirement:** Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is complete.

**Implementation:**
- Maintenance access via hosting environment (historical) requires authentication
- MFA for maintenance sessions to be implemented
- Maintenance session termination enforced
- Nonlocal maintenance access controlled

**Evidence:**
- hosting environment (historical) authentication (inherited)
- hosting environment (historical) MFA (inherited)
- Maintenance MFA Evidence: `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-110_Maintenance_MFA_Evidence.md`

**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented (Inherited from hosting environment (historical))

---

### 3.6 Supervise Maintenance Personnel (3.7.6)

**Requirement:** Supervise the maintenance activities of maintenance personnel without required access authorization.

**Implementation:**

## Signature & evidence record (enclave deployment)

Approval record is maintained via the Trust Codex Manual Governance workflow (per-document sign-off under C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-* or central app).

**What counts as the approval record** is the per-document sign-off artifact written under `C:\evidence`, which includes:
- attestor identity (name/title/org)
- timestamp (UTC)
- **document SHA-256 hash** (the exact version reviewed)
- **stored record location** (where the sign-off record is retained)

**Expected location (written by the manual app):**
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-221-signoff.json`
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-221-signoff.md`
