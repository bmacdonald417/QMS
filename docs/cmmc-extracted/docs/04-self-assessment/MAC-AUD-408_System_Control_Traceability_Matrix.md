# System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) - CMMC Level 2

**Document Version:** 1.5  
**Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Classification:** Internal Use  
**Compliance Framework:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced)  
**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 (All 110 Requirements)

**Applies to:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (FCI and CUI system)

---

## 1. Purpose

This System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) provides a comprehensive mapping of all 110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 requirements to their implementation, supporting policies, procedures, evidence, and status. This matrix enables assessors to trace each control from requirement to implementation to evidence.

**Admin Interface:** The SCTM is fully editable via the admin web interface at `/admin/compliance/sctm`. Administrators can update control status, policy references, procedure references, evidence locations, implementation details, and SSP section references directly through the UI without requiring file edits.

---

## 2. Matrix Structure

**For each control, the SCTM provides:**
- Control ID and requirement text
- Implementation status (Implemented/Inherited/Partially Satisfied/Not Implemented/Not Applicable)
- Policy reference
- Procedure reference
- Evidence location
- Implementation location (code/system)
- SSP section reference

**Note on infrastructure virtual machine (historical) (Linux distribution (historical)) Infrastructure:**
The infrastructure virtual machine (historical) (cui-vault-jamy) running the CUI vault infrastructure is now part of the system boundary. Many controls have VM-specific implementation requirements in addition to application-level implementations. For comprehensive VM control mapping and VM-specific evidence, see:
- **VM Control Mapping:** `../01-system-scope/MAC-IT-307_Google_VM_Control_Mapping.md`
- **VM Baseline Configuration:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-129_Google_VM_Baseline_Configuration.md`
- **VM Security Configuration:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-130_Google_VM_Security_Configuration.md`
- **VM Maintenance Procedures:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-131_Google_VM_Maintenance_Procedures.md`
- **VM Monitoring and Logging:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-132_Google_VM_Monitoring_Logging.md`
- **VM Gap Analysis:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-133_Google_VM_Gap_Analysis.md`

Controls with significant VM-specific requirements are noted in the Evidence column with VM-specific evidence documents.

---

**Note on endpoint operating system CUI Workspace VM (Endpoint):**
The hardened server endpoint VM used as the **CUI workspace** is part of the CUI system boundary. Some controls have endpoint-specific implementation requirements (account policy, remote access, logging, malware protection, least functionality, etc.).

For endpoint-specific evidence and an all-controls endpoint mapping, see:
- **endpoint operating system workspace hardening & verification:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-150_endpoint operating system_CUI_Workspace_Hardening_and_Verification_Evidence.md`
- **endpoint operating system endpoint mapping (all 110):** `windows-endpoint-control-mapping.csv` and `windows-endpoint-control-mapping.json`

## 17.2. NIST SP 800-171 Discussion Sections (Complete Text)

This section provides the complete verbatim DISCUSSION text from NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 for all controls. The DISCUSSION sections provide technical guidance and interpretation to facilitate implementation and assessment.

**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations

### AC - Access Control

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.1</strong> - Limit system access to authorized users, processes, devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.1**

**Requirement:**
Limit system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, and devices (including other systems).

**DISCUSSION:**

Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography)
control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users)
and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. Access
enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide
increased information security. Other systems include systems internal and external to the
organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The
definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account
type (e.g., privileged verses non-privileged) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.10</strong> - Session lock</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.10**

**Requirement:**
Use session lock with pattern-hiding displays to prevent access and viewing of data after a period of inactivity.

**DISCUSSION:**

Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the
immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of
their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined,
typically at the operating system level (but can also be at the application level). Session locks are
not an acceptable substitute for logging out of the system, for example, if organizations require
users to log out at the end of the workday.
Pattern-hiding displays can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with
screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen,
with the additional caveat that none of the images convey controlled unclassified information.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.11</strong> - Automatic session termination</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.11**

**Requirement:**
Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the
termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e.,
disconnecting from the network). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is
initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system.
Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating
network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user’s logical
session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to
continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session
termination can include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to
certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on system use.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.12</strong> - Monitor remote access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.12**

**Requirement:**
Monitor and control remote access sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users)
communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include
dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks
(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not
make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with
appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques for confidentiality protection), may
provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as
internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately monitor
network communications traffic for malicious code.
Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection
activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook
computers, smart phones, and tablets).
[SP 800-46], [SP 800-77], and [SP 800-113] provide guidance on secure remote access and virtual
private networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.13</strong> - Cryptographic remote access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.13**

**Requirement:**
Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography.
See [NIST CRYPTO]; [NIST CAVP]; [NIST CMVP]; National Security Agency Cryptographic Standards.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.14</strong> - Managed access control points</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.14**

**Requirement:**
Route remote access via managed access control points.

**DISCUSSION:**

Routing remote access through managed access control points enhances explicit, organizational
control over such connections, reducing the susceptibility to unauthorized access to organizational
systems resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.15</strong> - Authorize remote privileged commands</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.15**

**Requirement:**
Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant information.

**DISCUSSION:**

A privileged command is a human-initiated (interactively or via a process operating on behalf of
the human) command executed on a system involving the control, monitoring, or administration
of the system including security functions and associated security-relevant information. Securityrelevant information is any information within the system that can potentially impact the
operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result
in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data. Privileged
commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-critical, or security-relevant
system functions. Controlling such access from remote locations helps to ensure that unauthorized
individuals are not able to execute such commands freely with the potential to do serious or
catastrophic damage to organizational systems. Note that the ability to affect the integrity of the
system is considered security-relevant as that could enable the means to by-pass security functions
although not directly impacting the function itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.16</strong> - Authorize wireless access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.16**

**Requirement:**
Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.

**DISCUSSION:**

Establishing usage restrictions and configuration/connection requirements for wireless access to
the system provides criteria for organizations to support wireless access authorization decisions.
Such restrictions and requirements reduce the susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system
through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols which provide
credential protection and mutual authentication.
[SP 800-97] provide guidance on secure wireless networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.17</strong> - Protect wireless access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.17**

**Requirement:**
Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to help protect wireless access to the system.
Special attention is given to the wide variety of devices that are part of the Internet of Things with
potential wireless access to organizational systems. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.18</strong> - Control mobile devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.18**

**Requirement:**
Control connection of mobile devices.

**DISCUSSION:**

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried
by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly
transmit or receive information); possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and
includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication
capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, or built-in features for
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples of mobile devices include smart phones,
e-readers, and tablets.
Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities,
organizational restrictions may vary for the different types of devices. Usage restrictions and
implementation guidance for mobile devices include: device identification and authentication;
configuration management; implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious
code detection, firewall); scanning devices for malicious code; updating virus protection software;
scanning for critical software updates and patches; conducting primary operating system (and
possibly other resident software) integrity checks; and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g.,
wireless, infrared). The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond this
requirement. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other CUI security requirements.
[SP 800-124] provides guidance on mobile device security.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.19</strong> - Encrypt CUI on mobile devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.19**

**Requirement:**
Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms. 23

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the
confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices and computing platforms. Container-based encryption
provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information including
encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.2</strong> - Limit access to transactions/functions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.2**

**Requirement:**
Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. The term organizational system is used in many of the recommended CUI security requirements in this publication. This term has a specific meaning regarding the scope of applicability for the security requirements. The requirements apply only to the components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI, or that provide protection for the system components. The appropriate scoping for the CUI security requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risk for nonfederal organizations that have the responsibility of safeguarding CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of
account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group, system,
anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary. Other attributes
required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission or business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.20</strong> - Verify external systems</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.20**

**Requirement:**
Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no
direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls or the
determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems
include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-owned computing and
communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. This requirement also
addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, including
accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a
service) from organizational systems.
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with
organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the
types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If
23 Mobile devices and computing platforms include, for example, smartphones and tablets.
terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations
may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems
(e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations,
organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not
to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required
controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent
assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level
required by organizations.
Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision and
authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the
organization may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. And among the systems
that process CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore,
from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered
“external" to that system.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.21</strong> - Limit portable storage</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.21**

**Requirement:**
Limit use of portable storage devices on external systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems include
complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used
and under what conditions the devices may be used. Note that while “external” typically refers to
outside of the organization’s direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case.
Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that
process CUI and others that do not. Among the systems that process CUI there are likely access
restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system,
other systems within the organization may be considered “external" to that system.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.22</strong> - Control CUI on public systems</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.22**

**Requirement:**
Control CUI posted or processed on publicly accessible systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

In accordance with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards, the public
is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy
Act, CUI, and proprietary information). This requirement addresses systems that are controlled by
the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication.
Individuals authorized to post CUI onto publicly accessible systems are designated. The content of
information is reviewed prior to posting onto publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic
information is not included.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.3</strong> - Control flow of CUI</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.3**

**Requirement:**
Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.

**DISCUSSION:**

Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between
systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent
accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping exportcontrolled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic
that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the Internet that are not
from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations
based on data structures and content.
Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in
boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that
employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packetfiltering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message
content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations
also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware,
and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with different
security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies.
In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes:
prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only);
employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing
trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

<summary><strong>3.1.4</strong> - Separate duties</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.4**

**Requirement:**
Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

**DISCUSSION:**

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce
the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission
functions and system support functions among different individuals or roles; conducting system
support functions with different individuals (e.g., configuration management, quality assurance
and testing, system management, programming, and network security); and ensuring that security
personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because
separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider
the entirety of organizational systems and system components when developing policy on
separation of duties.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.5</strong> - Least privilege</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.5**

**Requirement:**
Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized accesses for
users and processes. The principle of least privilege is applied with the goal of authorized privileges
no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions.
Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as
necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development,
implementation, and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing
system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges).
Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator
for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to
specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information
or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this requirement between
allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the
ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to
sufficiently mitigate risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.6</strong> - Non-privileged accounts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.6**

**Requirement:**
Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The
inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such
as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in
the change of access authorizations for the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as
would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.7</strong> - Prevent privileged function execution</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.7**

**Requirement:**
Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.

**DISCUSSION:**

Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Nonprivileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing
intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are
examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this
requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in
3.1.2.
Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by
unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing
concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of privileged
functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider
threats and the advanced persistent threat.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.8</strong> - Limit unsuccessful logon attempts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.8**

**Requirement:**
Limit unsuccessful logon attempts.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection.
Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are, in most
cases, temporary and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the
organization (i.e., a delay algorithm). If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ
different algorithms for different system components based on the capabilities of the respective
components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating
system and application levels.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.9</strong> - Privacy/security notices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.9**

**Requirement:**
Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.

**DISCUSSION:**

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before
individuals log in to organizational systems. System use notifications are used only for access via
logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a secondary system use notification is
needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Where
necessary, posters or other printed materials may be used in lieu of an automated system banner.
Organizations consult with the Office of General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning
banner content.

</details>

### AT - Awareness and Training

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.1</strong> - Security awareness</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.1**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that managers, systems administrators, and users of organizational systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of those systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the content and frequency of security awareness training and security
awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the systems to which
personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for
information security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security
incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security
awareness techniques include: formal training; offering supplies inscribed with security reminders;
generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials; displaying logon screen
messages; displaying security awareness posters; and conducting information security awareness
events.
[SP 800-50] provides guidance on security awareness and training programs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.2</strong> - Security training</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that personnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned
duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of organizations and
the systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide system
developers, enterprise architects, security architects, acquisition/procurement officials, software
developers, system developers, systems integrators, system/network administrators, personnel
conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent
verification and validation, security assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level
software, security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties.
Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include
policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide
the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and
supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.3</strong> - Insider threat awareness</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.3**

**Requirement:**
Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

**DISCUSSION:**

Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as: inordinate,
long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job
performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow
employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, directives,
rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to communicate
employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through
appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and
procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g.,
training for managers may be focused on specific changes in behavior of team members, while
training for employees may be focused on more general observations).

</details>

### AU - Audit and Accountability

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.1</strong> - Create and retain audit logs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.1**

**Requirement:**
Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity.

**DISCUSSION:**

An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized
system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as
those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments
in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can
include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative
privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging,
organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security
requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs.
For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file
access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific
circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect
of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.
Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related
events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are
distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloudbased architectures.
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps,
source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or fail
indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes
can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state
of the system after the event occurred).
Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording
of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider
limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific
audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including
information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate
information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide
important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making.
[SP 800-92] provides guidance on security log management.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.2</strong> - Unique user traceability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so they can be held accountable for their actions.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement ensures that the contents of the audit record include the information needed to
link the audit event to the actions of an individual to the extent feasible. Organizations consider
logging for traceability including results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
connectivity, mobile device connection, communications at system boundaries, configuration
settings, physical access, nonlocal maintenance, use of maintenance tools, temperature and
humidity, equipment delivery and removal, system component inventory, use of mobile code, and
use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.3</strong> - Review and update logged events</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.3**

**Requirement:**
Review and update logged events.

**DISCUSSION:**

The intent of this requirement is to periodically re-evaluate which logged events will continue to
be included in the list of events to be logged. The event types that are logged by organizations may
change over time. Reviewing and updating the set of logged event types periodically is necessary
to ensure that the current set remains necessary and sufficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.4</strong> - Alert on audit logging failure</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.4**

**Requirement:**
Alert in the event of an audit logging process failure.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in the audit record
capturing mechanisms, and audit record storage capacity being reached or exceeded. This
requirement applies to each audit record data storage repository (i.e., distinct system component
where audit records are stored), the total audit record storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all
audit record data storage repositories combined), or both.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.5</strong> - Correlate audit records</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.5**

**Requirement:**
Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity.

**DISCUSSION:**

Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that they do not
operate independently, but rather collectively. Regarding the assessment of a given organizational
system, the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or
at the organization level across all systems.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.6</strong> - Audit record reduction/reporting</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.6**

**Requirement:**
Provide audit record reduction and report generation to support on-demand analysis and reporting.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes
such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction
and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or organizational
entities conducting auditing activities. Audit record reduction capability can include, for example,
modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit
records. The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable
reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp
in the record is insufficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.7</strong> - System clock synchronization</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.7**

**Requirement:**
Provide a system capability that compares and synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative source to generate time stamps for audit records.

**DISCUSSION:**

Internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps, which include date and time. Time is
expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time
(GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the
degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may
define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be
critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication,
depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. This requirement
provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected
over a network. See [IETF 5905].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.8</strong> - Protect audit information</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.8**

**Requirement:**
Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit log settings, and audit reports)
needed to successfully audit system activity. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices
used to conduct audit and logging activities. This requirement focuses on the technical protection
of audit information and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized
individuals. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection and physical
and environmental protection requirements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.9</strong> - Limit audit logging management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.9**

**Requirement:**
Limit management of audit logging functionality to a subset of privileged users.

**DISCUSSION:**

Individuals with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by that
system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit logging activities or
modifying audit records. This requirement specifies that privileged access be further defined
between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related
privileges.

</details>

### CM - Configuration Management

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.1</strong> - Baseline configurations</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.1**

**Requirement:**
Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles.

**DISCUSSION:**

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for
systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
future builds, releases, and changes to systems. Baseline configurations include information about
system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and update
and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings and
parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system
architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current enterprise architecture.
Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational
systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance includes reviewing and updating
the baseline configuration when changes are made based on security risks and deviations from the
established baseline configuration
Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include components
from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting
inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability
(e.g., system association, system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective
accountability of system components includes hardware inventory specifications, software license
information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or
devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include manufacturer,
device type, model, serial number, and physical location.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on security-focused configuration management.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.2</strong> - Security configuration settings</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.2**

**Requirement:**
Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or functionality of the system.
Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined
include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input and output devices (e.g., scanners,
copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data
switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware,
and applications.
Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the
parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: registry
settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols,
and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and
subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become
part of the systems configuration baseline.
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide
recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings
for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those
system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be
developed by a variety of organizations including information technology product developers,
manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
in the public and private sectors.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.3</strong> - Change control</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.3**

**Requirement:**
Track, review, approve or disapprove, and log changes to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Tracking, reviewing, approving/disapproving, and logging changes is called configuration change
control. Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic proposal,
justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including
system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
configurations for components and configuration items of systems, changes to configuration
settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls,
routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate
vulnerabilities.
Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control Boards or
Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes to systems. For new
development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including
representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change
Advisory Boards. Audit logs of changes include activities before and after changes are made to
organizational systems and the activities required to implement such changes.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.4</strong> - Security impact analysis</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.4**

**Requirement:**
Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., system administrators,
system security officers, system security managers, and systems security engineers) conduct
security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary
skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems and the associated security
ramifications. Security impact analysis may include reviewing security plans to understand security
requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand the implementation of
controls and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also
include risk assessments to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if
additional controls are required.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control and security impact analysis.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.5</strong> - Change access restrictions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.5**

**Requirement:**
Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Any changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems can potentially have
significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only
qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including
upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
Access restrictions include physical and logical access control requirements, workflow automation,
media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than
directly into systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during certain specified
times). In addition to security concerns, commonly-accepted due diligence for configuration
management includes access restrictions as an essential part in ensuring the ability to effectively
manage the configuration.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.6</strong> - Least functionality</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.6**

**Requirement:**
Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational systems to provide only essential capabilities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services
routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single
system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any
one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function
per component.
Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to
determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized
connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize network
scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as
firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited
functions, ports, protocols, and services.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.7</strong> - Restrict nonessential programs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.7**

**Requirement:**
Restrict, disable, or prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services.

**DISCUSSION:**

Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to
approve program execution; prohibiting auto-execute; program blacklisting and whitelisting; or
restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time. The organization makes
a security-based determination which functions, ports, protocols, and/or services are restricted.
Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of protocols
organizations consider preventing the use of, restricting, or disabling.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.8</strong> - Software restriction policy</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.8**

**Requirement:**
Apply deny-by-exception (blacklisting) policy to prevent the use of unauthorized software or deny-all, permit-by-exception (whitelisting) policy to allow the execution of authorized software.

**DISCUSSION:**

The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on systems is
commonly referred to as blacklisting. The process used to identify software programs that are
authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. Whitelisting is the
stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting,
organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted software programs using, for example,
cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of whitelisted software
can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.
[SP 800-167] provides guidance on application whitelisting.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.9</strong> - Control user-installed software</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.9**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor user-installed software.

**DISCUSSION:**

Users can install software in organizational systems if provided the necessary privileges. To
maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
actions regarding software installation through policies. Permitted software installations include
updates and security patches to existing software and applications from organization-approved
“app stores.” Prohibited software installations may include software with unknown or suspect
pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies organizations
select governing user-installed software may be organization-developed or provided by some
external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods, automated methods, or
both.

### IA - Identification and Authentication

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.1</strong> - Identify users</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.1**

**Requirement:**
Identify system users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices.

**DISCUSSION:**

Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses,
or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared
system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names associated with the system
accounts assigned to those individuals. Organizations may require unique identification of
individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. In addition, this
requirement addresses individual identifiers that are not necessarily associated with system
accounts. Organizational devices requiring identification may be defined by type, by device, or by
a combination of type/device.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.10</strong> - Cryptographically-protected passwords</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.10**

**Requirement:**
Store and transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographically-protected passwords use salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.
See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.11</strong> - Obscure authentication feedback</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.11**

**Requirement:**
Obscure feedback of authentication information.

**DISCUSSION:**

The feedback from systems does not provide any information that would allow unauthorized
individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems or system
components, for example, desktop or notebook computers with relatively large monitors, the
threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
components, for example, mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant,
and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small
keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.
Obscuring authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into
input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.2</strong> - Authenticate users</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.2**

**Requirement:**
Authenticate (or verify) the identities of users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards, cryptographic devices, and
one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator,
for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about authenticator content
include the minimum password length. Developers ship system components with factory default
authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for
various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, validation time window
for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification
stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when
no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote
maintenance. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords.

<summary><strong>3.5.3</strong> - MFA for privileged accounts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.3**

**Requirement:**
Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts. 24 25

**DISCUSSION:**

Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to authenticate. The
factors are defined as something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]);
something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or something you are (e.g.,
biometric). Multifactor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include
hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart
cards. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also
employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased
information security.
Access to organizational systems is defined as local access or network access. Local access is any
access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such
access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to
systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through
network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that
involves communication through external networks. The use of encrypted virtual private networks
for connections between organization-controlled and non-organization controlled endpoints may
be treated as internal networks with regard to protecting the confidentiality of information.
24 Multifactor authentication requires two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors include:
something you know (e.g., password/PIN); something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
something you are (e.g., biometric). The requirement for multifactor authentication should not be interpreted as
requiring federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC)-like
solutions. A variety of multifactor solutions (including those with replay resistance) using tokens and biometrics are
commercially available. Such solutions may employ hard tokens (e.g., smartcards, key fobs, or dongles) or soft tokens
to store user credentials.
25 Local access is any access to a system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a
direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to a system by a user (or a process
acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, Internet).

<summary><strong>3.5.4</strong> - Replay-resistant authentication</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.4**

**Requirement:**
Employ replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged and nonprivileged accounts.

**DISCUSSION:**

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by
recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include
protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.

<summary><strong>3.5.6</strong> - Disable identifiers after inactivity</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.6**

**Requirement:**
Disable identifiers after a defined period of inactivity.

**DISCUSSION:**

Inactive identifiers pose a risk to organizational information because attackers may exploit an
inactive identifier to gain undetected access to organizational devices. The owners of the inactive
accounts may not notice if unauthorized access to the account has been obtained.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.7</strong> - Password complexity</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.7**

**Requirement:**
Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new passwords are created.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as
individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are used as part of
multifactor authenticators. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes
required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. To mitigate certain
brute force attacks against passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.8</strong> - Prohibit password reuse</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.8**

**Requirement:**
Prohibit password reuse for a specified number of generations.

**DISCUSSION:**

Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.9</strong> - Temporary passwords</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.9**

**Requirement:**
Allow temporary password use for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.

**DISCUSSION:**

Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures
that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest
opportunity, reducing the susceptibility to authenticator compromises.

### IR - Incident Response

<details>
<summary><strong>3.6.1</strong> - Operational incident-handling capability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.1**

**Requirement:**
Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent on the capabilities of
organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems.
Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of
mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling
capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business
owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel
security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk
executive.
As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is
linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that
the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users
may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system
administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and
incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery,
and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of
suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes
incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access
to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required.
[SP 800-61] provides guidance on incident handling. [SP 800-86] and [SP 800-101] provide guidance
on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. [SP 800-161] provides guidance on
supply chain risk management.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.6.2</strong> - Track, document, and report incidents</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.2**

**Requirement:**
Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal and external to the organization.

**DISCUSSION:**

Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining records about each
incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics,
evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network
monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports.
Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and
the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization. Suspected security incidents may
also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially
contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the
reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders,
directives, regulations, and policies.
[SP 800-61] provides guidance on incident handling.

<summary><strong>3.6.3</strong> - Test incident response capability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.3**

**Requirement:**
Test the organizational incident response capability.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the effectiveness of the capabilities
and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of
checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (both parallel and full interrupt), and
comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects
on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and
individuals due to incident response.

### MA - Maintenance

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.1</strong> - Perform maintenance</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.1**

**Requirement:**
Perform maintenance on organizational systems.26

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses the information security aspects of the system maintenance program
and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including hardware, firmware,
applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity. System maintenance also includes those
components not directly associated with information processing and data or information retention
such as scanners, copiers, and printers.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.2</strong> - Controls on maintenance tools</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.2**

**Requirement:**
Provide controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct system maintenance.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses security-related issues with maintenance tools that are not within the
organizational system boundaries that process, store, or transmit CUI, but are used specifically for
diagnostic and repair actions on those systems. Organizations have flexibility in determining the
26 In general, system maintenance requirements tend to support the security objective of availability. However,
improper system maintenance or a failure to perform maintenance can result in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI,
thus compromising confidentiality of that information.
controls in place for maintenance tools, but can include approving, controlling, and monitoring the
use of such tools. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting malicious code, either
intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and into organizational systems. Maintenance tools
can include hardware, software, and firmware items, for example, hardware and software
diagnostic test equipment and hardware and software packet sniffers.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.3</strong> - Sanitize equipment for off-site maintenance</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.3**

**Requirement:**
Ensure equipment removed for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses the information security aspects of system maintenance that are
performed off-site and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including
applications) conducted by a local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in- house,
software maintenance agreement).
[SP 800-88] provides guidance on media sanitization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.4</strong> - Check maintenance media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.4**

**Requirement:**
Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance diagnostic and test programs, organizations
determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with incident
handling policies and procedures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.5</strong> - MFA for nonlocal maintenance</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.5**

**Requirement:**
Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is complete.

**DISCUSSION:**

Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals
communicating through an external network. The authentication techniques employed in the
establishment of these nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
requirements in 3.5.3.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.6</strong> - Supervise maintenance personnel</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.6**

**Requirement:**
Supervise the maintenance activities of maintenance personnel without required access authorization.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to individuals who are performing hardware or software maintenance on
organizational systems, while 3.10.1 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance
duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff,
physical plant maintenance personnel). Individuals not previously identified as authorized
maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, consultants, and
systems integrators, may require privileged access to organizational systems, for example, when
required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to
issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on organizational risk assessments.
Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

### MP - Media Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.1</strong> - Protect system media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.1**

**Requirement:**
Protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital.

**DISCUSSION:**

System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic
tapes, external and removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Protecting digital media includes limiting access
to design specifications stored on compact disks or flash drives in the media library to the project
leader and any individuals on the development team. Physically controlling system media includes
conducting inventories, maintaining accountability for stored media, and ensuring procedures are
in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library. Secure storage
includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library.
Access to CUI on system media can be limited by physically controlling such media, which includes
conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and
return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media.
[SP 800-111] provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.2**

**Requirement:**
Limit access to CUI on system media to authorized users.

**DISCUSSION:**

Access can be limited by physically controlling system media and secure storage areas. Physically
controlling system media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to
allow individuals to check out and return system media to the media library, and maintaining
accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a
controlled media library.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.3</strong> - Sanitize/destroy media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.3**

**Requirement:**
Sanitize or destroy system media containing CUI before disposal or release for reuse.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse.
Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components, scanners, copiers,
printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media such as paper and
microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information
cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging,
cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized
individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal.
Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction may
be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization.
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures for
media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or deemed to have
no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of
non-digital media includes destruction, removing CUI from documents, or redacting selected
sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner
equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words or sections from the document. NARA policy
and guidance control sanitization processes for controlled unclassified information.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.5</strong> - Control access during transport</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.5**

**Requirement:**
Control access to media containing CUI and maintain accountability for media during transport outside of controlled areas.

**DISCUSSION:**

Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural
controls to meet the requirements established for protecting systems and information. Controls
to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers and cryptography.
Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon
the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as
those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the
appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier
personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of
media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and
tracking and obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the
transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to portable storage devices (e.g., USB memory sticks, digital video disks,
compact disks, external or removable hard disk drives). See [NIST CRYPTO].
[SP 800-111] provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.7</strong> - Control removable media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.7**

**Requirement:**
Control the use of removable media on system components.

**DISCUSSION:**

In contrast to requirement 3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts
the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash
drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls
(e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. Organizations
may control the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on
workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to
insert, read, or write to such devices.
Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including
devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable

storage devices based on the type of device, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices,
and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.8</strong> - Prohibit portable storage without owner</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.8**

**Requirement:**
Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner.

**DISCUSSION:**

Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage
devices reduces the overall risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign
responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., insertion
of malicious code).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.9</strong> - Protect backup CUI</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.9**

**Requirement:**
Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations can employ cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical controls to protect
the confidentiality of backup information at designated storage locations. Backed-up information
containing CUI may include system-level information and user-level information. System-level
information includes system-state information, operating system software, application software,
and licenses. User-level information includes information other than system-level information.

### PS - Personnel Security

<details>
<summary><strong>3.9.1</strong> - Screen individuals prior to access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.9.1**

**Requirement:**
Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Personnel security screening (vetting) activities involve the evaluation/assessment of individual’s
conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the trustworthiness of the
individual) prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI. The screening
activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
specific criteria established for the level of access required for assigned positions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.9.2</strong> - Protect systems during/after personnel actions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.9.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that organizational systems containing CUI are protected during and after personnel actions such as terminations and transfers.

**DISCUSSION:**

Protecting CUI during and after personnel actions may include returning system-related property
and conducting exit interviews. System-related property includes hardware authentication tokens,
identification cards, system administration technical manuals, keys, and building passes. Exit
interviews ensure that individuals who have been terminated understand the security constraints
imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for system-related
property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include reminding terminated individuals
of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may
not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment,
illnesses, and non-availability of supervisors. For termination actions, timely execution is essential
for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the
system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.
This requirement applies to reassignments or transfers of individuals when the personnel action is
permanent or of such extended durations as to require protection. Organizations define the CUI
protections appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or
extended. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other positions
within organizations include returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building
passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system accounts and
establishing new accounts; and providing for access to official records to which individuals had
access at previous work locations and in previous system accounts.

### PE - Physical Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.10.1</strong> - Limit physical access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.10.1**

**Requirement:**
Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to employees, individuals with permanent physical access authorization
credentials, and visitors. Authorized individuals have credentials that include badges, identification
cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed
consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, procedures, and
guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas within facilities that have not been designated
as publicly accessible.
Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or other
secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only; and placing equipment in
locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing devices, external disk
drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio
devices are examples of equipment.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.10.2**

**Requirement:**
Protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Monitoring of physical access includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. This
can be accomplished, for example, by the employment of guards; the use of sensor devices; or the
use of video surveillance equipment such as cameras. Examples of support infrastructure include
system distribution, transmission, and power lines. Security controls applied to the support
infrastructure prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may
also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions.
Physical access controls to support infrastructure include locked wiring closets; disconnected or
locked spare jacks; protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays; and wiretapping sensors.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural
(e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by
a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points,
interior access points to systems or system components requiring supplemental access controls,
or both. System components(e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated
as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.

### RA - Risk Assessment

<details>
<summary><strong>3.11.1</strong> - Periodically assess risk</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.11.1**

**Requirement:**
Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from the operation of organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Such risk
assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations,
organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of organizational systems.
Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors
operating systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational systems,
outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either formal or informal, can be conducted at the
organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level, and at any phase in
the system development life cycle.
[SP 800-30] provides guidance on conducting risk assessments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.11.2</strong> - Scan for vulnerabilities</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.11.2**

**Requirement:**
Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, ensuring
that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not
overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are
discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential
vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability
analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static
analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can
employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static
analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews.
Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols,
and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly
configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.
To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability
Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for
vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential
vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the
nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the
subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization
to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the
sensitive nature of such scanning.

<summary><strong>3.11.3</strong> - Remediate vulnerabilities</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.11.3**

**Requirement:**
Remediate vulnerabilities in accordance with risk assessments.

**DISCUSSION:**

Vulnerabilities discovered, for example, via the scanning conducted in response to 3.11.2, are
remediated with consideration of the related assessment of risk. The consideration of risk
influences the prioritization of remediation efforts and the level of effort to be expended in the
remediation for specific vulnerabilities.

### CA - Security Assessment

<details>
<summary><strong>3.12.1</strong> - Periodically assess security controls</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.1**

**Requirement:**
Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations assess security controls in organizational systems and the environments in which
those systems operate as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the
safeguards or countermeasures organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By
assessing the implemented security controls, organizations determine if the security safeguards or
countermeasures are in place and operating as intended. Security control assessments ensure that
information security is built into organizational systems; identify weaknesses and deficiencies early
in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions;
and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the
implemented security controls as documented in system security plans.
Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary
by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the
security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results are provided
to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted.
Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination
of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor
independence. Organizations can choose to use other types of assessment activities such as
vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of systems during
the system life cycle.
[SP 800-53] provides guidance on security and privacy controls for systems and organizations. [SP
800-53A] provides guidance on developing security assessment plans and conducting assessments.

<summary><strong>3.12.2</strong> - Develop and implement POA&M</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.2**

**Requirement:**
Develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

The plan of action is a key document in the information security program. Organizations develop
plans of action that describe how any unimplemented security requirements will be met and how
any planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document the system security
plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any chosen format.
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted
by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with
the nonfederal organization. [NIST CUI] provides supplemental material for Special Publication
800-171 including templates for plans of action.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.12.3</strong> - Monitor security controls</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.3**

**Requirement:**
Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

**DISCUSSION:**

Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and
information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous
and ongoing imply that organizations assess and analyze security controls and information
security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. The results of
continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations.
Providing access to security information on a continuing basis through reports or dashboards gives
organizational officials the capability to make effective and timely risk management decisions.
Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, firmware inventories, and
other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs
are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.
Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may also be referenced in
other requirements.
[SP 800-137] provides guidance on continuous monitoring.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.12.4</strong> - Develop/update SSP</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.4**

**Requirement:**
Develop, document, and periodically update system security plans that describe system boundaries, system environments of operation, how security requirements are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems. 28

**DISCUSSION:**

System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security
plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls meet those security requirements,
but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls.
28 There is no prescribed format or specified level of detail for system security plans. However, organizations ensure
that the required information in 3.12.4 is conveyed in those plans.
System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that
is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk if
the plan is implemented as intended. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can
be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security
plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g.,
design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This
reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains
security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to
enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted
by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with
the nonfederal organization.
[SP 800-18] provides guidance on developing security plans. [NIST CUI] provides supplemental
material for Special Publication 800-171 including templates for system security plans.

### SC - System and Communications Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.1</strong> - Monitor/control/protect communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.1**

**Requirement:**
Monitor, control, and protect communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and by
restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components include
gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization
systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security architecture (e.g., routers
protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or
prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications
traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that
appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial
telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated
management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third
party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent
sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
[SP 800-41] provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. [SP 800-125B] provides guidance on
security for virtualization technologies.

<summary><strong>3.13.10</strong> - Cryptographic key management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.10**

**Requirement:**
Establish and manage cryptographic keys for cryptography employed in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures
or mechanisms supported by manual procedures. Organizations define key management
requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives,
regulations, and standards specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters.
[SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-57-1] provide guidance on cryptographic key management and key
establishment.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.11</strong> - FIPS-validated cryptography</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.11**

**Requirement:**
Employ FIPS-validated cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptography can be employed to support many security solutions including the protection of
controlled unclassified information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of
information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such
information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to
support random number generation and hash generation. Cryptographic standards include FIPSvalidated cryptography and/or NSA-approved cryptography. See [NIST CRYPTO]; [NIST CAVP];
and [NIST CMVP].

<summary><strong>3.13.12</strong> - Collaborative computing devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.12**

**Requirement:**
Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and provide indication of devices in use to users present at the device.29

**DISCUSSION:**

Collaborative computing devices include networked white boards, cameras, and microphones.
Indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated.
Dedicated video conferencing systems, which rely on one of the participants calling or connecting
to the other party to activate the video conference, are excluded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.13</strong> - Control mobile code</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.13**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor the use of mobile code.

**DISCUSSION:**

Mobile code technologies include Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Flash animations,
and VBScript. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code in organizational systems are based on
the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Usage restrictions
and implementation guidance apply to the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers
and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations, notebook computers,
and devices (e.g., smart phones). Mobile code policy and procedures address controlling or
preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code in
systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed by a trusted source.
29 Dedicated video conferencing systems, which rely on one of the participants calling or connecting to the other
party to activate the video conference, are excluded.
[SP 800-28] provides guidance on mobile code.

<summary><strong>3.13.14</strong> - Control VoIP</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.14**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

**DISCUSSION:**

VoIP has different requirements, features, functionality, availability, and service limitations when
compared with the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) (i.e., the standard telephone service). In
contrast, other telephone services are based on high-speed, digital communications lines, such
as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The
main distinctions between POTS and non-POTS services are speed and bandwidth. To address
the threats associated with VoIP, usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on
the potential for the VoIP technology to cause damage to the system if it is used maliciously.
Threats to VoIP are similar to those inherent with any Internet-based application.
[SP 800-58] provides guidance on Voice Over IP Systems.

<summary><strong>3.13.15</strong> - Protect authenticity of communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.15**

**Requirement:**
Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking,
and the insertion of false information into communications sessions. This requirement addresses
communications protection at the session versus packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented
architectures providing web-based services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends
of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of
information transmitted.
[SP 800-77], [SP 800-95], and [SP 800-113] provide guidance on secure communications sessions.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.16</strong> - Protect CUI at rest</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.16**

**Requirement:**
Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.

**DISCUSSION:**

Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is
located on storage devices as specific components of systems. The focus of protection at rest is
not on the type of storage device or the frequency of access but rather the state of the
information. Organizations can use different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality protections,
including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Organizations may also
use other controls including secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved or continuous monitoring to
identify malicious code at rest. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.2</strong> - Architectural designs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.2**

**Requirement:**
Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems or
systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security
engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The
application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop trustworthy,
secure, and resilient systems and system components and reduce the susceptibility of
organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples of these concepts and principles
include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, architecture, and controls as
the foundation for design; incorporating security requirements into the system development life
cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on
how to build secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents,
attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.
Organizations that apply security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the
development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce
risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions.
[SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on systems security engineering.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.3</strong> - Separate user/system management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.3**

**Requirement:**
Separate user functionality from system management functionality.

**DISCUSSION:**

System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network
components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation
of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical. Organizations
can implement separation of system management functionality from user functionality by using
different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems,
or different network addresses; virtualization techniques; or combinations of these or other
methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative interfaces that use
separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system
and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and
with additional access controls.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.4</strong> - Prevent unauthorized information transfer</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.4**

**Requirement:**
Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

**DISCUSSION:**

The control of information in shared system resources (e.g., registers, cache memory, main
memory, hard disks) is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information
protection. This requirement prevents information produced by the actions of prior users or roles
(or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to any
current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain
access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system.
This requirement also applies to encrypted representations of information. This requirement does
not address information remanence, which refers to residual representation of data that has been
nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage or timing channels) where shared resources
are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which
there are only single users or roles.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.5</strong> - Implement subnetworks</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.5**

**Requirement:**
Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks.

**DISCUSSION:**

Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as
demilitarized zones (DMZs). DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control devices and
techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud-based technologies.
[SP 800-41] provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. [SP 800-125B] provides guidance on
security for virtualization technologies.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.6</strong> - Deny-by-default network communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.6**

**Requirement:**
Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the system
boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network
communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and
approved are allowed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.7</strong> - Prevent remote device dual connections</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.7**

**Requirement:**
Prevent remote devices from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with organizational systems and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks (i.e., split tunneling).

**DISCUSSION:**

Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources
such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling allows unauthorized external connections,
making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. This
requirement is implemented in remote devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, and
tablets) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by
preventing configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This requirement is
implemented in the system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that
allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device
is using split tunneling.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.8</strong> - Cryptographic mechanisms for CUI in transit</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.8**

**Requirement:**
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can
transmit information including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices,
printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines. Communication paths outside the physical
protection of controlled boundaries are susceptible to both interception and modification.
Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity
services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to
individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
implementation of the controls for transmission confidentiality. In such situations, organizations
determine what types of confidentiality services are available in commercial telecommunication
service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances
of the effectiveness of the safeguards through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations
implement compensating safeguards or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example of an
alternative physical safeguard is a protected distribution system (PDS) where the distribution
medium is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring the confidentiality
of the information being transmitted. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.9</strong> - Terminate network connections</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.9**

**Requirement:**
Terminate network connections associated with communications sessions at the end of the sessions or after a defined period of inactivity.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections
associated with communications sessions include de-allocating associated TCP/IP address or port
pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application
level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection.
Time periods of user inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by
type of network access or for specific network accesses.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.14.1</strong> - Identify/report/correct flaws</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.1**

**Requirement:**
Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include
patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered
during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error
handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in
remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems.
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary
based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability
related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than
other types of remediation.

<summary><strong>3.14.2</strong> - Malicious code protection</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.2**

**Requirement:**
Provide protection from malicious code at designated locations within organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, remoteaccess servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and
spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained
within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography.
Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic
mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur
through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational
missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always
detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including
secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes,
and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the
functions intended.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.3**

**Requirement:**
Monitor system security alerts and advisories and take action in response.

**DISCUSSION:**

There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For example,
the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal
government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and
industry information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and
advisories. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant external organizations, for
example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers,
and peer or supporting organizations

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.4**

**Requirement:**
Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.

**DISCUSSION:**

Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational
missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always

<summary><strong>3.14.5</strong> - Periodic/real-time scans</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.5**

**Requirement:**
Perform periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

**DISCUSSION:**

Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources can
detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE,
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as
steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web
accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious

<details>
<summary><strong>3.14.6</strong> - Monitor systems and communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.6**

**Requirement:**
Monitor organizational systems, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

**DISCUSSION:**

System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the
observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and
boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the
system. Organizations can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in
real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access,
and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. System
monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion
detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical
applications, with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of
monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the
capability of systems to support such objectives.
System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs.
Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response
programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a
network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device
communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote
connections can be either wired or wireless.
Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound communications
traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in systems or
propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling
to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised
systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific
types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

**DISCUSSION:**

System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. System monitoring can detect
unauthorized use of organizational systems. System monitoring is an integral part of continuous
monitoring and incident response programs. Monitoring is achieved through a variety of tools and
techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code
protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring
software). Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident
response programs.
Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications

MAPPING TABLES
MAPPING BASIC AND DERIVED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROLS
ables D-1 through D-14 provide a mapping of the basic and derived security requirements
to the security controls in [SP 800-53].31 The mapping tables are included for informational
purposes and do not impart additional security requirements beyond those requirements
defined in Chapter Three. In some cases, the security controls include additional expectations
beyond those required to protect CUI and have been tailored using the criteria in Chapter Two.
Only the portion of the security control relevant to the security requirement is applicable. The
tables also include a secondary mapping of the security controls to the relevant controls in [ISO
27001]. An asterisk (*) indicates that the ISO/IEC control does not fully satisfy the intent of the
NIST control. Due to the tailoring actions carried out to develop the security requirements,
satisfaction of a basic or derived requirement does not imply the corresponding NIST security
control or control enhancement in [SP 800-53] has also been satisfied, since certain elements of
the control or control enhancement that are not essential to protecting the confidentiality of
CUI are not reflected in those requirements.
Organizations that have implemented or plan to implement the [NIST CSF] can use the mapping
of the security requirements to the security controls in [SP 800-53] and [ISO 27001] to locate the
equivalent controls in the Categories and Subcategories associated with the core Functions of
the Cybersecurity Framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The control
mapping information can be useful to organizations that wish to demonstrate compliance to the
security requirements in the context of their established information security programs, when
such programs have been built around the NIST or ISO/IEC security controls.
31 The security controls in Tables D-1 through D-14 are taken from NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. These
tables will be updated upon publication of [SP 800-53B] which will provide an update to the moderate security control
baseline consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5. Changes to the moderate baseline will affect
future updates to the basic and derived security requirements in Chapter Three.

## 17.2. NIST SP 800-171 Discussion Sections (Complete Text)

This section provides the complete verbatim DISCUSSION text from NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 for all controls. The DISCUSSION sections provide technical guidance and interpretation to facilitate implementation and assessment.

**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations

### AC - Access Control

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.1</strong> - Limit system access to authorized users, processes, devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.1**

**Requirement:**
Limit system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, and devices (including other systems).

**DISCUSSION:**

Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography)
control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users)
and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. Access
enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide
increased information security. Other systems include systems internal and external to the
organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The
definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account
type (e.g., privileged verses non-privileged) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.10</strong> - Session lock</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.10**

**Requirement:**
Use session lock with pattern-hiding displays to prevent access and viewing of data after a period of inactivity.

**DISCUSSION:**

Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the
immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of
their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined,
typically at the operating system level (but can also be at the application level). Session locks are
not an acceptable substitute for logging out of the system, for example, if organizations require
users to log out at the end of the workday.
Pattern-hiding displays can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with
screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen,
with the additional caveat that none of the images convey controlled unclassified information.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.11</strong> - Automatic session termination</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.11**

**Requirement:**
Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the
termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e.,
disconnecting from the network). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is
initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system.
Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating
network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user’s logical
session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to
continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session
termination can include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to
certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on system use.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.12</strong> - Monitor remote access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.12**

**Requirement:**
Monitor and control remote access sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users)
communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include
dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks
(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not
make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with
appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques for confidentiality protection), may
provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as
internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately monitor
network communications traffic for malicious code.
Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection
activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook
computers, smart phones, and tablets).
[SP 800-46], [SP 800-77], and [SP 800-113] provide guidance on secure remote access and virtual
private networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.13</strong> - Cryptographic remote access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.13**

**Requirement:**
Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography.
See [NIST CRYPTO]; [NIST CAVP]; [NIST CMVP]; National Security Agency Cryptographic Standards.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.14</strong> - Managed access control points</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.14**

**Requirement:**
Route remote access via managed access control points.

**DISCUSSION:**

Routing remote access through managed access control points enhances explicit, organizational
control over such connections, reducing the susceptibility to unauthorized access to organizational
systems resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.15</strong> - Authorize remote privileged commands</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.15**

**Requirement:**
Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant information.

**DISCUSSION:**

A privileged command is a human-initiated (interactively or via a process operating on behalf of
the human) command executed on a system involving the control, monitoring, or administration
of the system including security functions and associated security-relevant information. Securityrelevant information is any information within the system that can potentially impact the
operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result
in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data. Privileged
commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-critical, or security-relevant
system functions. Controlling such access from remote locations helps to ensure that unauthorized
individuals are not able to execute such commands freely with the potential to do serious or
catastrophic damage to organizational systems. Note that the ability to affect the integrity of the
system is considered security-relevant as that could enable the means to by-pass security functions
although not directly impacting the function itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.16</strong> - Authorize wireless access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.16**

**Requirement:**
Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.

**DISCUSSION:**

Establishing usage restrictions and configuration/connection requirements for wireless access to
the system provides criteria for organizations to support wireless access authorization decisions.
Such restrictions and requirements reduce the susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system
through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols which provide
credential protection and mutual authentication.
[SP 800-97] provide guidance on secure wireless networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.17</strong> - Protect wireless access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.17**

**Requirement:**
Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to help protect wireless access to the system.
Special attention is given to the wide variety of devices that are part of the Internet of Things with
potential wireless access to organizational systems. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.18</strong> - Control mobile devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.18**

**Requirement:**
Control connection of mobile devices.

**DISCUSSION:**

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried
by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly
transmit or receive information); possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and
includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication
capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, or built-in features for
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples of mobile devices include smart phones,
e-readers, and tablets.
Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities,
organizational restrictions may vary for the different types of devices. Usage restrictions and
implementation guidance for mobile devices include: device identification and authentication;
configuration management; implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious
code detection, firewall); scanning devices for malicious code; updating virus protection software;
scanning for critical software updates and patches; conducting primary operating system (and
possibly other resident software) integrity checks; and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g.,
wireless, infrared). The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond this
requirement. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other CUI security requirements.
[SP 800-124] provides guidance on mobile device security.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.19</strong> - Encrypt CUI on mobile devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.19**

**Requirement:**
Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms. 23

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the
confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices and computing platforms. Container-based encryption
provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information including
encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.2</strong> - Limit access to transactions/functions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.2**

**Requirement:**
Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. The term organizational system is used in many of the recommended CUI security requirements in this publication. This term has a specific meaning regarding the scope of applicability for the security requirements. The requirements apply only to the components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI, or that provide protection for the system components. The appropriate scoping for the CUI security requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risk for nonfederal organizations that have the responsibility of safeguarding CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of
account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group, system,
anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary. Other attributes
required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission or business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.20</strong> - Verify external systems</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.20**

**Requirement:**
Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no
direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls or the
determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems
include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-owned computing and
communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. This requirement also
addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, including
accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a
service) from organizational systems.
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with
organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the
types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If
23 Mobile devices and computing platforms include, for example, smartphones and tablets.
terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations
may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems
(e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations,
organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not
to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required
controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent
assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level
required by organizations.
Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision and
authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the
organization may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. And among the systems
that process CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore,
from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered
“external" to that system.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.21</strong> - Limit portable storage</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.21**

**Requirement:**
Limit use of portable storage devices on external systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems include
complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used
and under what conditions the devices may be used. Note that while “external” typically refers to
outside of the organization’s direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case.
Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that
process CUI and others that do not. Among the systems that process CUI there are likely access
restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system,
other systems within the organization may be considered “external" to that system.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.22</strong> - Control CUI on public systems</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.22**

**Requirement:**
Control CUI posted or processed on publicly accessible systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

In accordance with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards, the public
is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy
Act, CUI, and proprietary information). This requirement addresses systems that are controlled by
the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication.
Individuals authorized to post CUI onto publicly accessible systems are designated. The content of
information is reviewed prior to posting onto publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic
information is not included.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.3</strong> - Control flow of CUI</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.3**

**Requirement:**
Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.

**DISCUSSION:**

Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between
systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent
accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping exportcontrolled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic
that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the Internet that are not
from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations
based on data structures and content.
Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in
boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that
employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packetfiltering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message
content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations
also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware,
and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with different
security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies.
In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes:
prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only);
employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing
trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.4</strong> - Separate duties</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.4**

**Requirement:**
Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

**DISCUSSION:**

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce
the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission
functions and system support functions among different individuals or roles; conducting system
support functions with different individuals (e.g., configuration management, quality assurance
and testing, system management, programming, and network security); and ensuring that security
personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because
separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider
the entirety of organizational systems and system components when developing policy on
separation of duties.

<summary><strong>3.1.5</strong> - Least privilege</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.5**

**Requirement:**
Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized accesses for
users and processes. The principle of least privilege is applied with the goal of authorized privileges
no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions.
Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as
necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development,
implementation, and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing
system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges).
Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator
for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to
specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information
or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this requirement between
allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the
ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to
sufficiently mitigate risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.6</strong> - Non-privileged accounts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.6**

**Requirement:**
Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The
inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such
as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in
the change of access authorizations for the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as
would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.7</strong> - Prevent privileged function execution</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.7**

**Requirement:**
Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.

**DISCUSSION:**

Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Nonprivileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing
intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are
examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this
requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in
3.1.2.
Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by
unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing
concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of privileged
functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider
threats and the advanced persistent threat.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.8</strong> - Limit unsuccessful logon attempts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.8**

**Requirement:**
Limit unsuccessful logon attempts.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection.
Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are, in most
cases, temporary and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the
organization (i.e., a delay algorithm). If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ
different algorithms for different system components based on the capabilities of the respective
components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating
system and application levels.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1.9</strong> - Privacy/security notices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.1.9**

**Requirement:**
Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.

**DISCUSSION:**

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before
individuals log in to organizational systems. System use notifications are used only for access via
logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a secondary system use notification is
needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Where
necessary, posters or other printed materials may be used in lieu of an automated system banner.
Organizations consult with the Office of General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning
banner content.

### AT - Awareness and Training

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.1</strong> - Security awareness</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.1**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that managers, systems administrators, and users of organizational systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of those systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the content and frequency of security awareness training and security
awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the systems to which
personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for
information security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security
incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security
awareness techniques include: formal training; offering supplies inscribed with security reminders;
generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials; displaying logon screen
messages; displaying security awareness posters; and conducting information security awareness
events.
[SP 800-50] provides guidance on security awareness and training programs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.2</strong> - Security training</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that personnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned
duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of organizations and
the systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide system
developers, enterprise architects, security architects, acquisition/procurement officials, software
developers, system developers, systems integrators, system/network administrators, personnel
conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent
verification and validation, security assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level
software, security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties.
Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include
policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide
the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and
supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2.3</strong> - Insider threat awareness</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.2.3**

**Requirement:**
Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

**DISCUSSION:**

Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as: inordinate,
long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job
performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow
employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, directives,
rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to communicate
employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through
appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and
procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g.,
training for managers may be focused on specific changes in behavior of team members, while
training for employees may be focused on more general observations).

</details>

### AU - Audit and Accountability

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.1</strong> - Create and retain audit logs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.1**

**Requirement:**
Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity.

**DISCUSSION:**

An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized
system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as
those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments
in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can
include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative
privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging,
organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security
requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs.
For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file
access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific
circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect
of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.
Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related
events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are
distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloudbased architectures.
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps,
source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or fail
indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes
can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state
of the system after the event occurred).
Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording
of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider
limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific
audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including
information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate
information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide
important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making.
[SP 800-92] provides guidance on security log management.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.2</strong> - Unique user traceability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so they can be held accountable for their actions.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement ensures that the contents of the audit record include the information needed to
link the audit event to the actions of an individual to the extent feasible. Organizations consider
logging for traceability including results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
connectivity, mobile device connection, communications at system boundaries, configuration
settings, physical access, nonlocal maintenance, use of maintenance tools, temperature and
humidity, equipment delivery and removal, system component inventory, use of mobile code, and
use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.3</strong> - Review and update logged events</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.3**

**Requirement:**
Review and update logged events.

**DISCUSSION:**

The intent of this requirement is to periodically re-evaluate which logged events will continue to
be included in the list of events to be logged. The event types that are logged by organizations may
change over time. Reviewing and updating the set of logged event types periodically is necessary
to ensure that the current set remains necessary and sufficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.4</strong> - Alert on audit logging failure</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.4**

**Requirement:**
Alert in the event of an audit logging process failure.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in the audit record
capturing mechanisms, and audit record storage capacity being reached or exceeded. This
requirement applies to each audit record data storage repository (i.e., distinct system component
where audit records are stored), the total audit record storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all
audit record data storage repositories combined), or both.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.5</strong> - Correlate audit records</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.5**

**Requirement:**
Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity.

**DISCUSSION:**

Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that they do not
operate independently, but rather collectively. Regarding the assessment of a given organizational
system, the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or
at the organization level across all systems.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.6</strong> - Audit record reduction/reporting</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.6**

**Requirement:**
Provide audit record reduction and report generation to support on-demand analysis and reporting.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes
such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction
and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or organizational
entities conducting auditing activities. Audit record reduction capability can include, for example,
modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit
records. The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable
reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp
in the record is insufficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.7</strong> - System clock synchronization</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.7**

**Requirement:**
Provide a system capability that compares and synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative source to generate time stamps for audit records.

**DISCUSSION:**

Internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps, which include date and time. Time is
expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time
(GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the
degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may
define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be
critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication,
depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. This requirement
provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected
over a network. See [IETF 5905].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.8</strong> - Protect audit information</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.8**

**Requirement:**
Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

**DISCUSSION:**

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit log settings, and audit reports)
needed to successfully audit system activity. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices
used to conduct audit and logging activities. This requirement focuses on the technical protection
of audit information and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized
individuals. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection and physical
and environmental protection requirements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.3.9</strong> - Limit audit logging management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.3.9**

**Requirement:**
Limit management of audit logging functionality to a subset of privileged users.

**DISCUSSION:**

Individuals with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by that
system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit logging activities or
modifying audit records. This requirement specifies that privileged access be further defined
between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related
privileges.

</details>

### CM - Configuration Management

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.1</strong> - Baseline configurations</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.1**

**Requirement:**
Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles.

**DISCUSSION:**

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for
systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
future builds, releases, and changes to systems. Baseline configurations include information about
system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and update
and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings and
parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system
architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current enterprise architecture.
Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational
systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance includes reviewing and updating
the baseline configuration when changes are made based on security risks and deviations from the
established baseline configuration
Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include components
from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting
inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability
(e.g., system association, system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective
accountability of system components includes hardware inventory specifications, software license
information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or
devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include manufacturer,
device type, model, serial number, and physical location.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on security-focused configuration management.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.2</strong> - Security configuration settings</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.2**

**Requirement:**
Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or functionality of the system.
Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined
include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input and output devices (e.g., scanners,
copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data
switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware,
and applications.
Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the
parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: registry
settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols,
and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and
subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become
part of the systems configuration baseline.
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide
recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings
for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those
system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be
developed by a variety of organizations including information technology product developers,
manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
in the public and private sectors.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.3</strong> - Change control</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.3**

**Requirement:**
Track, review, approve or disapprove, and log changes to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Tracking, reviewing, approving/disapproving, and logging changes is called configuration change
control. Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic proposal,
justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including
system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
configurations for components and configuration items of systems, changes to configuration
settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls,
routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate
vulnerabilities.
Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control Boards or
Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes to systems. For new
development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including
representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change
Advisory Boards. Audit logs of changes include activities before and after changes are made to
organizational systems and the activities required to implement such changes.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.4</strong> - Security impact analysis</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.4**

**Requirement:**
Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., system administrators,
system security officers, system security managers, and systems security engineers) conduct
security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary
skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems and the associated security
ramifications. Security impact analysis may include reviewing security plans to understand security
requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand the implementation of
controls and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also
include risk assessments to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if
additional controls are required.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control and security impact analysis.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.5</strong> - Change access restrictions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.5**

**Requirement:**
Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Any changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems can potentially have
significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only
qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including
upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
Access restrictions include physical and logical access control requirements, workflow automation,
media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than
directly into systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during certain specified
times). In addition to security concerns, commonly-accepted due diligence for configuration
management includes access restrictions as an essential part in ensuring the ability to effectively
manage the configuration.
[SP 800-128] provides guidance on configuration change control.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.6</strong> - Least functionality</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.6**

**Requirement:**
Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational systems to provide only essential capabilities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services
routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single
system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any
one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function
per component.
Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to
determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized
connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize network
scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as
firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited
functions, ports, protocols, and services.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.7</strong> - Restrict nonessential programs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.7**

**Requirement:**
Restrict, disable, or prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services.

**DISCUSSION:**

Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to
approve program execution; prohibiting auto-execute; program blacklisting and whitelisting; or
restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time. The organization makes
a security-based determination which functions, ports, protocols, and/or services are restricted.
Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of protocols
organizations consider preventing the use of, restricting, or disabling.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.8</strong> - Software restriction policy</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.8**

**Requirement:**
Apply deny-by-exception (blacklisting) policy to prevent the use of unauthorized software or deny-all, permit-by-exception (whitelisting) policy to allow the execution of authorized software.

**DISCUSSION:**

The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on systems is
commonly referred to as blacklisting. The process used to identify software programs that are
authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. Whitelisting is the
stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting,
organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted software programs using, for example,
cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of whitelisted software
can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.
[SP 800-167] provides guidance on application whitelisting.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.4.9</strong> - Control user-installed software</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.4.9**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor user-installed software.

**DISCUSSION:**

Users can install software in organizational systems if provided the necessary privileges. To
maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
actions regarding software installation through policies. Permitted software installations include
updates and security patches to existing software and applications from organization-approved
“app stores.” Prohibited software installations may include software with unknown or suspect
pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies organizations
select governing user-installed software may be organization-developed or provided by some
external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods, automated methods, or
both.

### IA - Identification and Authentication

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.1</strong> - Identify users</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.1**

**Requirement:**
Identify system users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices.

**DISCUSSION:**

Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses,
or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared
system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names associated with the system
accounts assigned to those individuals. Organizations may require unique identification of
individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. In addition, this
requirement addresses individual identifiers that are not necessarily associated with system
accounts. Organizational devices requiring identification may be defined by type, by device, or by
a combination of type/device.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.10</strong> - Cryptographically-protected passwords</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.10**

**Requirement:**
Store and transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographically-protected passwords use salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.
See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.11</strong> - Obscure authentication feedback</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.11**

**Requirement:**
Obscure feedback of authentication information.

**DISCUSSION:**

The feedback from systems does not provide any information that would allow unauthorized
individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems or system
components, for example, desktop or notebook computers with relatively large monitors, the
threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
components, for example, mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant,
and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small
keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.
Obscuring authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into
input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.2</strong> - Authenticate users</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.2**

**Requirement:**
Authenticate (or verify) the identities of users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards, cryptographic devices, and
one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator,
for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about authenticator content
include the minimum password length. Developers ship system components with factory default
authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for
various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, validation time window
for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification
stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when
no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote
maintenance. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.5.3</strong> - MFA for privileged accounts</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.3**

**Requirement:**
Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts. 24 25

**DISCUSSION:**

Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to authenticate. The
factors are defined as something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]);
something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or something you are (e.g.,
biometric). Multifactor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include
hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart
cards. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also
employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased
information security.
Access to organizational systems is defined as local access or network access. Local access is any
access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such
access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to
systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through
network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that
involves communication through external networks. The use of encrypted virtual private networks
for connections between organization-controlled and non-organization controlled endpoints may
be treated as internal networks with regard to protecting the confidentiality of information.
24 Multifactor authentication requires two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors include:
something you know (e.g., password/PIN); something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
something you are (e.g., biometric). The requirement for multifactor authentication should not be interpreted as
requiring federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC)-like
solutions. A variety of multifactor solutions (including those with replay resistance) using tokens and biometrics are
commercially available. Such solutions may employ hard tokens (e.g., smartcards, key fobs, or dongles) or soft tokens
to store user credentials.
25 Local access is any access to a system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a
direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to a system by a user (or a process
acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, Internet).

<summary><strong>3.5.4</strong> - Replay-resistant authentication</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.5.4**

**Requirement:**
Employ replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged and nonprivileged accounts.

**DISCUSSION:**

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by
recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include
protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.

### IR - Incident Response

<details>
<summary><strong>3.6.1</strong> - Operational incident-handling capability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.1**

**Requirement:**
Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent on the capabilities of
organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems.
Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of
mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling
capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business
owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel
security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk
executive.
As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is
linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that
the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users
may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system
administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and
incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery,
and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of
suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes
incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access
to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required.
[SP 800-61] provides guidance on incident handling. [SP 800-86] and [SP 800-101] provide guidance
on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. [SP 800-161] provides guidance on
supply chain risk management.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.2**

**Requirement:**
Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal and external to the organization.

**DISCUSSION:**

Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining records about each
incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics,
evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network
monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports.
Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and
the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization. Suspected security incidents may
also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially
contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the
reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders,
directives, regulations, and policies.
[SP 800-61] provides guidance on incident handling.

<summary><strong>3.6.3</strong> - Test incident response capability</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.6.3**

**Requirement:**
Test the organizational incident response capability.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the effectiveness of the capabilities
and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of
checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (both parallel and full interrupt), and
comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects
on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and
individuals due to incident response.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses security-related issues with maintenance tools that are not within the
organizational system boundaries that process, store, or transmit CUI, but are used specifically for
diagnostic and repair actions on those systems. Organizations have flexibility in determining the
26 In general, system maintenance requirements tend to support the security objective of availability. However,
improper system maintenance or a failure to perform maintenance can result in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI,
thus compromising confidentiality of that information.
controls in place for maintenance tools, but can include approving, controlling, and monitoring the
use of such tools. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting malicious code, either
intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and into organizational systems. Maintenance tools
can include hardware, software, and firmware items, for example, hardware and software
diagnostic test equipment and hardware and software packet sniffers.

Ensure equipment removed for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement addresses the information security aspects of system maintenance that are
performed off-site and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including
applications) conducted by a local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in- house,
software maintenance agreement).
[SP 800-88] provides guidance on media sanitization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.4</strong> - Check maintenance media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.4**

**Requirement:**
Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance diagnostic and test programs, organizations
determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with incident
handling policies and procedures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.5</strong> - MFA for nonlocal maintenance</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.5**

**Requirement:**
Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is complete.

**DISCUSSION:**

Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals
communicating through an external network. The authentication techniques employed in the
establishment of these nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
requirements in 3.5.3.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.7.6</strong> - Supervise maintenance personnel</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.7.6**

**Requirement:**
Supervise the maintenance activities of maintenance personnel without required access authorization.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to individuals who are performing hardware or software maintenance on
organizational systems, while 3.10.1 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance
duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff,
physical plant maintenance personnel). Individuals not previously identified as authorized
maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, consultants, and
systems integrators, may require privileged access to organizational systems, for example, when
required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to
issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on organizational risk assessments.
Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

### MP - Media Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.1</strong> - Protect system media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.1**

**Requirement:**
Protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital.

**DISCUSSION:**

System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic
tapes, external and removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Protecting digital media includes limiting access
to design specifications stored on compact disks or flash drives in the media library to the project
leader and any individuals on the development team. Physically controlling system media includes
conducting inventories, maintaining accountability for stored media, and ensuring procedures are
in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library. Secure storage
includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library.
Access to CUI on system media can be limited by physically controlling such media, which includes
conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and
return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media.
[SP 800-111] provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.2**

**Requirement:**
Limit access to CUI on system media to authorized users.

**DISCUSSION:**

Access can be limited by physically controlling system media and secure storage areas. Physically
controlling system media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to
allow individuals to check out and return system media to the media library, and maintaining
accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a
controlled media library.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.3</strong> - Sanitize/destroy media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.3**

**Requirement:**
Sanitize or destroy system media containing CUI before disposal or release for reuse.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse.
Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components, scanners, copiers,
printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media such as paper and
microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information
cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging,
cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized
individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal.
Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction may
be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization.
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures for
media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or deemed to have
no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of
non-digital media includes destruction, removing CUI from documents, or redacting selected
sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner
equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words or sections from the document. NARA policy
and guidance control sanitization processes for controlled unclassified information.
[SP 800-88] provides guidance on media sanitization.

<summary><strong>3.8.4</strong> - Mark media with CUI markings</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.4**

**Requirement:**
Mark media with necessary CUI markings and distribution limitations.27

**DISCUSSION:**

The term security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security attributes.
System media includes digital and non-digital media. Marking of system media reflects applicable
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations. See [NARA MARK].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.5</strong> - Control access during transport</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.5**

**Requirement:**
Control access to media containing CUI and maintain accountability for media during transport outside of controlled areas.

**DISCUSSION:**

Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural
controls to meet the requirements established for protecting systems and information. Controls
to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers and cryptography.
Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon
the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as
those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the
appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier
personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of
media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and
tracking and obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the
transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.6**

**Requirement:**
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of CUI stored on digital media during transport unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to portable storage devices (e.g., USB memory sticks, digital video disks,
compact disks, external or removable hard disk drives). See [NIST CRYPTO].
[SP 800-111] provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.7</strong> - Control removable media</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.7**

**Requirement:**
Control the use of removable media on system components.

**DISCUSSION:**

In contrast to requirement 3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts
the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash
drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls
(e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. Organizations
may control the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on
workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to
insert, read, or write to such devices.
Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including
devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable

storage devices based on the type of device, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices,
and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.8</strong> - Prohibit portable storage without owner</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.8**

**Requirement:**
Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner.

**DISCUSSION:**

Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage
devices reduces the overall risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign
responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., insertion
of malicious code).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.8.9</strong> - Protect backup CUI</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.8.9**

**Requirement:**
Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations can employ cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical controls to protect
the confidentiality of backup information at designated storage locations. Backed-up information
containing CUI may include system-level information and user-level information. System-level
information includes system-state information, operating system software, application software,
and licenses. User-level information includes information other than system-level information.

### PS - Personnel Security

<details>
<summary><strong>3.9.1</strong> - Screen individuals prior to access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.9.1**

**Requirement:**
Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Personnel security screening (vetting) activities involve the evaluation/assessment of individual’s
conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the trustworthiness of the
individual) prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI. The screening
activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
specific criteria established for the level of access required for assigned positions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.9.2</strong> - Protect systems during/after personnel actions</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.9.2**

**Requirement:**
Ensure that organizational systems containing CUI are protected during and after personnel actions such as terminations and transfers.

**DISCUSSION:**

Protecting CUI during and after personnel actions may include returning system-related property
and conducting exit interviews. System-related property includes hardware authentication tokens,
identification cards, system administration technical manuals, keys, and building passes. Exit
interviews ensure that individuals who have been terminated understand the security constraints
imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for system-related
property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include reminding terminated individuals
of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may
not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment,
illnesses, and non-availability of supervisors. For termination actions, timely execution is essential
for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the
system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.
This requirement applies to reassignments or transfers of individuals when the personnel action is
permanent or of such extended durations as to require protection. Organizations define the CUI
protections appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or
extended. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other positions
within organizations include returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building
passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system accounts and
establishing new accounts; and providing for access to official records to which individuals had
access at previous work locations and in previous system accounts.

### PE - Physical Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.10.1</strong> - Limit physical access</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.10.1**

**Requirement:**
Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to employees, individuals with permanent physical access authorization
credentials, and visitors. Authorized individuals have credentials that include badges, identification
cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed
consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, procedures, and
guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas within facilities that have not been designated
as publicly accessible.
Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or other
secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only; and placing equipment in
locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing devices, external disk
drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio
devices are examples of equipment.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.10.2**

**Requirement:**
Protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Monitoring of physical access includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. This
can be accomplished, for example, by the employment of guards; the use of sensor devices; or the
use of video surveillance equipment such as cameras. Examples of support infrastructure include
system distribution, transmission, and power lines. Security controls applied to the support
infrastructure prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may
also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions.
Physical access controls to support infrastructure include locked wiring closets; disconnected or
locked spare jacks; protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays; and wiretapping sensors.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural
(e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by
a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points,
interior access points to systems or system components requiring supplemental access controls,
or both. System components(e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated
as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.

### RA - Risk Assessment

<details>
<summary><strong>3.11.1</strong> - Periodically assess risk</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.11.1**

**Requirement:**
Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from the operation of organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Such risk
assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations,
organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of organizational systems.
Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors
operating systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational systems,
outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either formal or informal, can be conducted at the
organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level, and at any phase in
the system development life cycle.
[SP 800-30] provides guidance on conducting risk assessments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.11.2</strong> - Scan for vulnerabilities</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.11.2**

**Requirement:**
Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, ensuring
that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not
overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are
discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential
vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability
analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static
analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can
employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static
analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews.
Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols,
and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly
configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.
To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability
Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for
vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential
vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the
nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the
subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization
to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the
sensitive nature of such scanning.

### CA - Security Assessment

<details>
<summary><strong>3.12.1</strong> - Periodically assess security controls</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.1**

**Requirement:**
Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations assess security controls in organizational systems and the environments in which
those systems operate as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the
safeguards or countermeasures organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By
assessing the implemented security controls, organizations determine if the security safeguards or
countermeasures are in place and operating as intended. Security control assessments ensure that
information security is built into organizational systems; identify weaknesses and deficiencies early
in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions;
and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the
implemented security controls as documented in system security plans.
Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary
by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the
security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results are provided
to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted.
Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination
of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor
independence. Organizations can choose to use other types of assessment activities such as
vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of systems during
the system life cycle.
[SP 800-53] provides guidance on security and privacy controls for systems and organizations. [SP
800-53A] provides guidance on developing security assessment plans and conducting assessments.

<summary><strong>3.12.2</strong> - Develop and implement POA&M</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.2**

**Requirement:**
Develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

The plan of action is a key document in the information security program. Organizations develop
plans of action that describe how any unimplemented security requirements will be met and how
any planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document the system security
plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any chosen format.
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted
by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with
the nonfederal organization. [NIST CUI] provides supplemental material for Special Publication
800-171 including templates for plans of action.

<summary><strong>3.12.3</strong> - Monitor security controls</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.3**

**Requirement:**
Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

**DISCUSSION:**

Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and
information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous
and ongoing imply that organizations assess and analyze security controls and information
security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. The results of
continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations.
Providing access to security information on a continuing basis through reports or dashboards gives
organizational officials the capability to make effective and timely risk management decisions.
Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, firmware inventories, and
other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs
are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.
Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may also be referenced in
other requirements.
[SP 800-137] provides guidance on continuous monitoring.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.12.4</strong> - Develop/update SSP</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.12.4**

**Requirement:**
Develop, document, and periodically update system security plans that describe system boundaries, system environments of operation, how security requirements are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems. 28

**DISCUSSION:**

System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security
plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls meet those security requirements,
but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls.
28 There is no prescribed format or specified level of detail for system security plans. However, organizations ensure
that the required information in 3.12.4 is conveyed in those plans.
System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that
is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk if
the plan is implemented as intended. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can
be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security
plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g.,
design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This
reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains
security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to
enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted
by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with
the nonfederal organization.
[SP 800-18] provides guidance on developing security plans. [NIST CUI] provides supplemental
material for Special Publication 800-171 including templates for system security plans.

### SC - System and Communications Protection

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.1</strong> - Monitor/control/protect communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.1**

**Requirement:**
Monitor, control, and protect communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and by
restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components include
gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization
systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security architecture (e.g., routers
protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or
prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications
traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that
appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial
telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated
management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third
party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent
sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
[SP 800-41] provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. [SP 800-125B] provides guidance on
security for virtualization technologies.

<summary><strong>3.13.10</strong> - Cryptographic key management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.10**

**Requirement:**
Establish and manage cryptographic keys for cryptography employed in organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures
or mechanisms supported by manual procedures. Organizations define key management
requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives,
regulations, and standards specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters.
[SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-57-1] provide guidance on cryptographic key management and key
establishment.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.11</strong> - FIPS-validated cryptography</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.11**

**Requirement:**
Employ FIPS-validated cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI.

**DISCUSSION:**

Cryptography can be employed to support many security solutions including the protection of
controlled unclassified information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of
information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such
information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to
support random number generation and hash generation. Cryptographic standards include FIPSvalidated cryptography and/or NSA-approved cryptography. See [NIST CRYPTO]; [NIST CAVP];
and [NIST CMVP].

<summary><strong>3.13.12</strong> - Collaborative computing devices</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.12**

**Requirement:**
Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and provide indication of devices in use to users present at the device.29

**DISCUSSION:**

Collaborative computing devices include networked white boards, cameras, and microphones.
Indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated.
Dedicated video conferencing systems, which rely on one of the participants calling or connecting
to the other party to activate the video conference, are excluded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.13</strong> - Control mobile code</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.13**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor the use of mobile code.

**DISCUSSION:**

Mobile code technologies include Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Flash animations,
and VBScript. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code in organizational systems are based on
the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Usage restrictions
and implementation guidance apply to the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers
and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations, notebook computers,
and devices (e.g., smart phones). Mobile code policy and procedures address controlling or
preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code in
systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed by a trusted source.
29 Dedicated video conferencing systems, which rely on one of the participants calling or connecting to the other
party to activate the video conference, are excluded.

<summary><strong>3.13.14</strong> - Control VoIP</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.14**

**Requirement:**
Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

**DISCUSSION:**

VoIP has different requirements, features, functionality, availability, and service limitations when
compared with the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) (i.e., the standard telephone service). In
contrast, other telephone services are based on high-speed, digital communications lines, such
as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The
main distinctions between POTS and non-POTS services are speed and bandwidth. To address
the threats associated with VoIP, usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on
the potential for the VoIP technology to cause damage to the system if it is used maliciously.
Threats to VoIP are similar to those inherent with any Internet-based application.
[SP 800-58] provides guidance on Voice Over IP Systems.

<summary><strong>3.13.15</strong> - Protect authenticity of communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.15**

**Requirement:**
Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

**DISCUSSION:**

Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking,
and the insertion of false information into communications sessions. This requirement addresses
communications protection at the session versus packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented
architectures providing web-based services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends
of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of
information transmitted.
[SP 800-77], [SP 800-95], and [SP 800-113] provide guidance on secure communications sessions.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.16</strong> - Protect CUI at rest</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.16**

**Requirement:**
Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.

**DISCUSSION:**

Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is
located on storage devices as specific components of systems. The focus of protection at rest is
not on the type of storage device or the frequency of access but rather the state of the
information. Organizations can use different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality protections,
including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Organizations may also
use other controls including secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved or continuous monitoring to
identify malicious code at rest. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.2</strong> - Architectural designs</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.2**

**Requirement:**
Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems or
systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security
engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The
application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop trustworthy,
secure, and resilient systems and system components and reduce the susceptibility of
organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples of these concepts and principles
include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, architecture, and controls as
the foundation for design; incorporating security requirements into the system development life
cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on
how to build secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents,
attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.
Organizations that apply security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the
development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce
risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.3</strong> - Separate user/system management</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.3**

**Requirement:**
Separate user functionality from system management functionality.

**DISCUSSION:**

System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network
components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation
of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical. Organizations
can implement separation of system management functionality from user functionality by using
different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems,
or different network addresses; virtualization techniques; or combinations of these or other
methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative interfaces that use
separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system
and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and
with additional access controls.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.4</strong> - Prevent unauthorized information transfer</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.4**

**Requirement:**
Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

**DISCUSSION:**

The control of information in shared system resources (e.g., registers, cache memory, main
memory, hard disks) is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information
protection. This requirement prevents information produced by the actions of prior users or roles
(or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to any
current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain
access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system.
This requirement also applies to encrypted representations of information. This requirement does
not address information remanence, which refers to residual representation of data that has been
nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage or timing channels) where shared resources
are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which
there are only single users or roles.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.5</strong> - Implement subnetworks</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.5**

**Requirement:**
Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks.

**DISCUSSION:**

Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as
demilitarized zones (DMZs). DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control devices and
techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud-based technologies.
[SP 800-41] provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. [SP 800-125B] provides guidance on
security for virtualization technologies.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.6</strong> - Deny-by-default network communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.6**

**Requirement:**
Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the system
boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network
communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and
approved are allowed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.7</strong> - Prevent remote device dual connections</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.7**

**Requirement:**
Prevent remote devices from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with organizational systems and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks (i.e., split tunneling).

**DISCUSSION:**

Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources
such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling allows unauthorized external connections,
making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. This
requirement is implemented in remote devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, and
tablets) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by
preventing configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This requirement is
implemented in the system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that
allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device
is using split tunneling.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.8</strong> - Cryptographic mechanisms for CUI in transit</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.8**

**Requirement:**
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can
transmit information including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices,
printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines. Communication paths outside the physical
protection of controlled boundaries are susceptible to both interception and modification.
Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity
services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to
individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
implementation of the controls for transmission confidentiality. In such situations, organizations
determine what types of confidentiality services are available in commercial telecommunication
service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances
of the effectiveness of the safeguards through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations
implement compensating safeguards or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example of an
alternative physical safeguard is a protected distribution system (PDS) where the distribution
medium is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring the confidentiality
of the information being transmitted. See [NIST CRYPTO].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3.13.9</strong> - Terminate network connections</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.13.9**

**Requirement:**
Terminate network connections associated with communications sessions at the end of the sessions or after a defined period of inactivity.

**DISCUSSION:**

This requirement applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections
associated with communications sessions include de-allocating associated TCP/IP address or port
pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application
level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection.
Time periods of user inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by
type of network access or for specific network accesses.

<summary><strong>3.14.1</strong> - Identify/report/correct flaws</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.1**

**Requirement:**
Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner.

**DISCUSSION:**

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include
patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered
during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error
handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in
remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems.
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary
based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability
related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than
other types of remediation.

<summary><strong>3.14.2</strong> - Malicious code protection</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.2**

**Requirement:**
Provide protection from malicious code at designated locations within organizational systems.

**DISCUSSION:**

Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, remoteaccess servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and
spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained
within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography.
Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic
mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur
through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational
missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always
detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including
secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes,
and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the
functions intended.

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.3**

**Requirement:**
Monitor system security alerts and advisories and take action in response.

**DISCUSSION:**

There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For example,
the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal
government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and
industry information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and
advisories. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant external organizations, for
example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers,
and peer or supporting organizations

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.4**

**Requirement:**
Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.

**DISCUSSION:**

Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.5**

**Requirement:**
Perform periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

**DISCUSSION:**

Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources can
detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE,
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as
steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web
accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious

<details>
<summary><strong>3.14.6</strong> - Monitor systems and communications</summary>

**NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.6**

**Requirement:**
Monitor organizational systems, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

**DISCUSSION:**

System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the
observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and
boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the
system. Organizations can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in
real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access,
and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. System
monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion
detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical
applications, with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of
monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the
capability of systems to support such objectives.
System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs.
Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response
programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a
network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device
communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote
connections can be either wired or wireless.
Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound communications
traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in systems or
propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling
to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised
systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific
types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

**DISCUSSION:**

System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. System monitoring can detect
unauthorized use of organizational systems. System monitoring is an integral part of continuous
monitoring and incident response programs. Monitoring is achieved through a variety of tools and
techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code
protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring
software). Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident
response programs.
Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications

MAPPING TABLES
MAPPING BASIC AND DERIVED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROLS
ables D-1 through D-14 provide a mapping of the basic and derived security requirements
to the security controls in [SP 800-53].31 The mapping tables are included for informational
purposes and do not impart additional security requirements beyond those requirements
defined in Chapter Three. In some cases, the security controls include additional expectations
beyond those required to protect CUI and have been tailored using the criteria in Chapter Two.
Only the portion of the security control relevant to the security requirement is applicable. The
tables also include a secondary mapping of the security controls to the relevant controls in [ISO
27001]. An asterisk (*) indicates that the ISO/IEC control does not fully satisfy the intent of the
NIST control. Due to the tailoring actions carried out to develop the security requirements,
satisfaction of a basic or derived requirement does not imply the corresponding NIST security
control or control enhancement in [SP 800-53] has also been satisfied, since certain elements of
the control or control enhancement that are not essential to protecting the confidentiality of
CUI are not reflected in those requirements.
Organizations that have implemented or plan to implement the [NIST CSF] can use the mapping
of the security requirements to the security controls in [SP 800-53] and [ISO 27001] to locate the
equivalent controls in the Categories and Subcategories associated with the core Functions of
the Cybersecurity Framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The control
mapping information can be useful to organizations that wish to demonstrate compliance to the
security requirements in the context of their established information security programs, when
such programs have been built around the NIST or ISO/IEC security controls.
31 The security controls in Tables D-1 through D-14 are taken from NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. These
tables will be updated upon publication of [SP 800-53B] which will provide an update to the moderate security control
baseline consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5. Changes to the moderate baseline will affect
future updates to the basic and derived security requirements in Chapter Three.

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to authorize wireless access before allowing such connections. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (hosting environment (historical)). The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, servers, or network equipment that would require wireless access authorization.

2. **No Organizational Wireless Infrastructure**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any wireless access points, wireless networks, or wireless infrastructure. All system access occurs through standard web browsers over HTTPS connections to the cloud-hosted application.

3. **Remote Access Model**: All user access to the system is remote and occurs through standard web browsers. There are no organizational wireless networks that users connect to in order to access the system. Users access the system from their own networks (home, office, mobile) using standard internet connectivity.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational infrastructure where the organization directly manages wireless access points and must authorize wireless connections. Since the organization has no such infrastructure, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not maintain any wireless infrastructure that would require authorization controls. All system access is cloud-based and occurs through standard web browsers over standard internet connections.

#### Testing and Verification

**Verification Methods:**
- Code review: Verify implementation code exists
- Operational testing: Verify control functions as specified
- Configuration review: Verify settings are properly configured

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to protect wireless access using authentication and encryption. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (hosting environment (historical)). The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, servers, or network equipment that would require wireless access protection.

2. **No Organizational Wireless Infrastructure**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any wireless access points, wireless networks, or wireless infrastructure. All system access occurs through standard web browsers over HTTPS connections to the cloud-hosted application.

3. **Remote Access Model**: All user access to the system is remote and occurs through standard web browsers. There are no organizational wireless networks that users connect to in order to access the system. Users access the system from their own networks (home, office, mobile) using standard internet connectivity.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational infrastructure where the organization directly manages wireless access points and must protect wireless connections. Since the organization has no such infrastructure, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not maintain any wireless infrastructure that would require protection controls. All system access is cloud-based and occurs through standard web browsers over standard internet connections, with protection provided by TLS/HTTPS encryption.

<summary><strong>3.5.6</strong> - Disable identifiers after inactivity</summary>

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** Control fully implemented with authentication-time enforcement (assessor-safe approach). Inactive accounts are automatically disabled when they attempt to authenticate.

### 4.1 Code Implementation

- Inactivity disablement module: `lib/inactivity-disable.ts`
- Authentication-time enforcement: `lib/auth.ts` (NextAuth authorize function)
- Custom sign-in enforcement: `app/api/auth/custom-signin/route.ts`
- Admin API endpoint: `app/api/admin/users/disable-inactive/route.ts` (manual trigger)

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

- Inactivity period: 180 days (6 months)
- Database schema: User model with `lastLoginAt` field
- Enforcement method: Authentication-time check (enforced before allowing login)
  - No scheduler dependency
  - Always enforced at the moment of risk
  - C3PAO-friendly enforcement model

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

- **Primary enforcement:** Authentication-time check (automatic on every login attempt)
  - System checks inactivity before allowing login
  - If inactive (>180 days), account is disabled and login is rejected
  - If active, login proceeds normally
- Manual trigger via admin API endpoint (`/api/admin/users/disable-inactive`)
- Setup guide: `docs/INACTIVITY_DISABLE_ENFORCEMENT.md`

<summary><strong>3.5.9</strong> - Temporary passwords</summary>

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** Temporary password functionality implemented. System generates cryptographically secure temporary passwords for new user accounts and password resets. Users must change temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately upon first login. Temporary passwords expire after 72 hours.

### 4.1 Code Implementation

#### Temporary Password Generation

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/temporary-password.ts` - Core temporary password generation library
  - `generateTemporaryPassword()` (lines 30-60) - Generates 20-character cryptographically secure random password using `crypto.randomBytes()`
  - `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` (lines 95-100) - Returns expiration timestamp (72 hours from now)
  - `TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_CONFIG` (lines 10-18) - Configuration constants (minLength: 16, defaultLength: 20, expirationHours: 72)

**User Creation:**
- `app/api/admin/create-user/route.ts` (lines 41-43, 49-56, 114-120)
  - Line 42: `generateTemporaryPassword()` - Generates temporary password
  - Line 43: `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` - Sets 72-hour expiration
  - Lines 49-56: Creates user with `isTemporaryPassword: true`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`, `mustChangePassword: true`
  - Lines 114-120: Returns temporary password in API response

**Password Reset:**
- `app/api/admin/reset-user-password/route.ts` (lines 48-50, 65-74, 104-111)
  - Line 49: `generateTemporaryPassword()` - Generates temporary password
  - Line 50: `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` - Sets 72-hour expiration
  - Lines 65-74: Updates user with `isTemporaryPassword: true`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`, `mustChangePassword: true`
  - Lines 104-111: Returns temporary password in API response

#### Expiration Checking

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/temporary-password.ts`
  - `isTemporaryPasswordExpired()` (lines 82-89) - Validates if temporary password has expired
  - `validateTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` (lines 131-137 in `lib/password-policy.ts`) - Additional validation function

**Authentication:**
- `lib/auth.ts` (lines 83-93)
  - Lines 86-93: Checks `user.isTemporaryPassword` and `user.temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`
  - Line 88: Calls `isTemporaryPasswordExpired()` to validate expiration
  - Line 92: Rejects login if temporary password expired

**Database Schema:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 22-23)
  - `isTemporaryPassword: Boolean @default(false)` - Flag indicating temporary password
  - `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt: DateTime?` - Expiration timestamp

#### Forced Password Change

**Implementation Files:**
- `middleware.ts` (lines 38-43, 61-66)
  - Lines 39-42: Checks `session.user?.mustChangePassword` for `/user` routes, redirects to `/auth/change-password`
  - Lines 62-65: Checks `session.user?.mustChangePassword` for `/admin` routes, redirects to `/auth/change-password`
  - Lines 20-22: Allows `/auth/change-password` route without restriction

**Password Change:**
- `app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts` (lines 95-105, 131-147)
  - Lines 97-98: Detects if changing from temporary password (`wasTemporaryPassword`)
  - Lines 99-105: Updates user with `isTemporaryPassword: false`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt: null`, `mustChangePassword: false`
  - Lines 131-147: Logs temporary to permanent password change in audit trail

**Sign-In Flow:**
- `app/api/auth/custom-signin/route.ts` (lines 99-110)
  - Lines 100-110: Checks `user.mustChangePassword` BEFORE MFA enrollment
  - Returns `requiresPasswordChange: true` if password change needed
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` (lines 37-44)
  - Lines 37-44: Redirects to `/auth/change-password?required=true` if password change required
  - Ensures password change happens before MFA enrollment

**MFA Enrollment Protection:**
- `app/api/auth/mfa/enroll/route.ts` (lines 22-30)
  - Lines 22-30: Checks for `mustChangePassword` and rejects MFA enrollment if password change required
- `app/auth/mfa/enroll/page.tsx` (lines 18-38)
  - Lines 18-38: Client-side check for password change requirement, redirects if needed

**Features:**
- Cryptographically secure random password generation (20 characters) - `lib/temporary-password.ts:generateTemporaryPassword()`
- 72-hour expiration for temporary passwords - `lib/temporary-password.ts:getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()`
- Forced password change on first login - `middleware.ts` (lines 38-43, 61-66)
- Expired temporary passwords rejected at login - `lib/auth.ts` (lines 83-93)
- Audit logging for temporary password operations - `app/api/admin/create-user/route.ts`, `app/api/admin/reset-user-password/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts`

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to sanitize equipment containing CUI before releasing it for off-site maintenance. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment. CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault on cloud service provider (historical). The organization does not own, maintain, or have physical custody of any equipment (servers, storage devices, network equipment) that contains CUI or system components.

2. **No Customer Equipment**: The organization does not maintain any physical equipment that would require off-site maintenance. All system infrastructure is managed by the cloud service provider (hosting provider (historical)), and the organization has no physical access to or ownership of the underlying hardware.

3. **No Physical Media**: The system operates entirely in a digital environment with no physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices) that could be removed for maintenance. All data is stored in cloud databases with no physical storage components under organizational control.

4. **Service Provider Responsibility**: Equipment maintenance, including any sanitization requirements, is the responsibility of the cloud service provider (hosting provider (historical)). The organization has no equipment to sanitize or release for maintenance.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not own, maintain, or have physical custody of any equipment that would require sanitization before off-site maintenance. All system infrastructure is cloud-based and managed by the service provider.

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to mark media containing CUI with appropriate CUI markings. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Digital-Only Environment**: The system operates entirely in a digital environment with no physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices, CDs, DVDs, printed materials) that contains CUI. All CUI is stored in cloud databases and accessed through web browsers.

2. **No Physical Media**: The organization does not create, use, or maintain any physical media (removable storage devices, printed documents, backup tapes) that would require CUI markings. All data storage and access is digital and cloud-based.

3. **Cloud Storage**: All CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault database on cloud service provider (historical) with no physical storage components under organizational control. hosting provider (historical) infrastructure is prohibited from CUI storage. There are no physical media items that could be marked with CUI designations.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to physical media that contains CUI and must be marked to indicate the presence and handling requirements of CUI. Since the organization does not use physical media, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to control access to media containing CUI during transport. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment. CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault on cloud service provider (historical). The organization does not transport any physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices, printed documents) that contains CUI.

2. **No Physical Media Transport**: The organization does not create, use, or transport any physical media (removable storage devices, printed documents, backup tapes) that would require access controls during transport. All data storage and access is digital and cloud-based.

3. **Digital Data Transfer**: All CUI is transferred digitally over encrypted connections (TLS/HTTPS) through web browsers. There is no physical transport of media containing CUI that would require access controls.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to physical media containing CUI that must be transported and requires access controls during transport. Since the organization does not transport physical media, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for collaborative computing devices. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Web Application Architecture**: The system is a web application accessed through standard web browsers. The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any collaborative computing devices (video conferencing systems, interactive whiteboards, shared displays, telepresence systems) that are part of the system infrastructure.

2. **No Collaborative Devices**: The organization does not use or maintain any collaborative computing devices that are integrated with or provide access to the system. All system access occurs through standard web browsers on user-owned devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices).

3. **User-Controlled Devices**: Any collaborative computing devices that users may use (such as video conferencing systems for meetings) are user-controlled and not part of the system infrastructure. The system itself does not include or integrate with collaborative computing devices.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational collaborative computing devices that are part of the system infrastructure and require usage restrictions and implementation guidance. Since the system is a web application with no integrated collaborative devices, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the system is a web application with no integrated collaborative computing devices. All system access occurs through standard web browsers, and the organization does not deploy or maintain collaborative computing devices as part of the system infrastructure.

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to implement controls for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Web Application Architecture**: The system is a web application accessed through standard web browsers. The system does not include, integrate with, or provide VoIP functionality as part of its core capabilities.

2. **No VoIP Functionality**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any VoIP systems, VoIP infrastructure, or VoIP services as part of the system. The system does not provide voice communication capabilities, VoIP calling features, or integration with VoIP technologies.

3. **System Scope**: The system is designed for web-based data management and compliance tracking. It does not include voice communication features, telephony services, or VoIP components that would require control implementation.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational VoIP systems and services that are part of the system infrastructure and require security controls. Since the system is a web application with no VoIP functionality, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the system is a web application with no VoIP functionality. The system does not include, integrate with, or provide VoIP services, and therefore does not require VoIP control implementation.

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to prevent remote devices from maintaining simultaneous non-remote and remote connections. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **All Access is Remote**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (hosting environment (historical)), and all user access to the system is remote. There are no non-remote connections to the system, as the organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure or local network connections.

2. **No Non-Remote Connections**: The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, local area networks, or direct physical connections to system components. All system access occurs remotely through web browsers over the internet.

3. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system infrastructure is entirely cloud-based, and users access the system from remote locations (home, office, mobile) using standard web browsers. There are no scenarios where a device could maintain both a non-remote and remote connection simultaneously.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to environments where devices can maintain both non-remote (local network) and remote (internet) connections simultaneously. Since all system access is remote with no non-remote connections possible, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because all system access is remote, and there are no non-remote connections to the system. The system architecture does not support scenarios where dual connections (non-remote and remote) could occur simultaneously.
