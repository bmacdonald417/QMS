---

## 1. Purpose

This procedure provides detailed step-by-step instructions for identifying and reporting security incidents in the MacTech Solutions system. This procedure supports the Incident Response Policy (`MAC-POL-215_Incident_Response_Policy.md`).

---

## 2. Incident Identification Procedure

### 2.1 Detection Methods

Incidents may be identified through:

**Application Event Logs:**
- Review AppEvent table for suspicious activity
- Look for multiple failed login attempts
- Check for unauthorized administrative actions
- Review file upload events for policy violations

**Authentication Logs:**
- Review login and login_failed events
- Identify unusual access patterns
- Check for account compromise indicators

**System Monitoring:**
- Review hosting environment (historical) logs
- Check for system performance degradation
- Monitor for unexpected errors

**User Reports:**
- Users report suspicious activity
- Users report unauthorized access
- Users report system anomalies

**Security Scanning:**
- Review Dependabot alerts
- Review npm audit results
- Check for known vulnerabilities

### 2.2 Indicators of Compromise

Common indicators include:
- Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
- Unusual access patterns (time, location, frequency)
- Unauthorized administrative actions
- System performance degradation
- Unexpected system changes
- Suspicious file uploads
- Policy violations (e.g., CUI upload attempts)

### 2.3 Identification Steps

**Step 1: Observe Anomaly**
- User or system detects unusual activity
- Log review reveals suspicious events
- Monitoring alert triggers

**Step 2: Gather Initial Information**
- Record date and time of observation
- Note affected systems or accounts
- Capture screenshots or logs
- Document initial observations

**Step 3: Assess Severity**
- Determine if incident is critical, high, medium, or low severity
- Critical: Data breach, system compromise, unauthorized FCI access
- High: Account compromise, policy violations
- Medium: Suspicious activity, failed access attempts
- Low: Minor anomalies, false positives

**Step 4: Document Initial Findings**
- Create incident record
- Assign incident ID (if applicable)
- Record discovery time
- Note affected systems

## 3. Incident Reporting Procedure

### 3.1 Reporting Timeline

**Critical Incidents:** Report immediately (within 1 hour)
- Suspected data breach
- Unauthorized access to FCI
- System compromise
- Malware infections

**High Severity:** Report within 4 hours
- Account compromise
- Policy violations
- Unauthorized administrative actions

**Medium Severity:** Report within 24 hours
- Suspicious activity
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual access patterns

**Low Severity:** Report within 72 hours
- Minor anomalies
- False positives
- Non-critical issues

### 3.2 Reporting Channels

**Primary Contact:**
- **Email:** security@mactechsolutions.com
- **Phone:** [Designated escalation phone number]

**Alternative Contact:**
- Development team lead
- System administrator

**Note:** CMMC Level 2 does not require DoD or customer notification unless contractually required. The Security Contact determines if external notification is needed.

### 3.3 Report Contents

Incident reports must include:

1. **Incident Description:** What happened
2. **Discovery Time:** When was the incident discovered
3. **Affected Systems:** Which systems or data are affected
4. **Impact Assessment:** Potential or actual impact
5. **Initial Response:** Actions taken so far
6. **Evidence:** Logs, screenshots, or other evidence

### 3.4 Reporting Steps

**Step 1: Prepare Report**
- Gather all relevant information
- Collect evidence (logs, screenshots)
- Document incident details
- Assess initial impact

**Step 2: Contact Security Contact**
- Send email to security@mactechsolutions.com
- Include all required information
- Attach evidence if applicable
- Use subject line: "Security Incident Report - [Severity] - [Brief Description]"

**Step 3: Follow Up**
- Respond to Security Contact questions
- Provide additional information as requested
- Assist with investigation if needed

**Step 4: Document Reporting**
- Record report submission time
- Note Security Contact acknowledgment
- Track incident status

## Signature & evidence record (enclave deployment)

Approval record is maintained via the Trust Codex Manual Governance workflow (per-document sign-off under C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-* or central app).

**What counts as the approval record** is the per-document sign-off artifact written under `C:\evidence`, which includes:
- attestor identity (name/title/org)
- timestamp (UTC)
- **document SHA-256 hash** (the exact version reviewed)
- **stored record location** (where the sign-off record is retained)

**Expected location (written by the manual app):**
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-SOP-223-signoff.json`
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-SOP-223-signoff.md`
