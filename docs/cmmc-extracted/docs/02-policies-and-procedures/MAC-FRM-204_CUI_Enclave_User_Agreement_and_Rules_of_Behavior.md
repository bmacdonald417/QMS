## 1. Purpose

This agreement documents the user’s acknowledgement of conduct, responsibilities, and acceptable use requirements for access to the organization’s CUI enclave. This agreement is **required before an account is provisioned** and must be re-acknowledged at least annually and upon material policy changes.

This agreement references the Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM) boundary model, but it is **not limited** to SRM items. It includes user conduct expectations across data handling, system use, physical/remote environment, incident reporting, and monitoring consent.

## 4. Shared Responsibility Acknowledgement (SRM-informed)

☐ I understand that security responsibilities are distributed across customer/user responsibilities and inherited/provider controls.  
☐ I agree to comply with the responsibilities assigned to my role and environment boundary, including requirements documented and tracked in the Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM) process.

**Note:** SRM boundaries do not reduce user obligations. Users remain responsible for compliant handling of CUI and secure use of the enclave.

---

## 5. CUI Handling and Boundary Requirements

☐ I will access CUI **only** for authorized business purposes and only within the approved enclave boundary.  
☐ I will not copy, export, or store CUI outside approved enclave storage locations without explicit written authorization and approved workflow.  
☐ I will comply with CUI marking, handling, and transmission requirements applicable to the CUI categories handled by this system.

**Prohibited examples (unless explicitly authorized):**
- Uploading CUI to personal email, personal cloud drives, or consumer messaging platforms
- Copying CUI to personal devices, removable media, screenshots, clipboard managers, or unmanaged notes
- Printing CUI without documented authorization and secure disposal process

---

## 6. Account, Credential, and Session Responsibilities

☐ I will not share my account, credentials, tokens, or MFA factors with anyone.  
☐ I will use only approved authentication methods (including MFA when required).  
☐ I will lock my workstation when unattended and log out of enclave sessions when finished.  
☐ I will immediately report suspected credential compromise, suspicious prompts, or unexpected access behavior.

---

## 7. Approved Endpoints and Remote Work Environment

☐ I will access the enclave only from **approved endpoints** and network environments as defined by the organization.  
☐ I will keep my endpoint in a secure state (patching, malware protection, disk encryption where required, and no unauthorized software).  
☐ I will not access CUI in public/uncontrolled locations where shoulder-surfing, recording, or unauthorized observation can occur.

---

## 8. Portable Media and External Systems

☐ I will not use removable media for CUI unless explicitly authorized and the media has an identifiable owner and approved handling workflow.  
☐ I will not connect unapproved external devices to enclave endpoints or otherwise introduce data into the enclave without approved scanning/transfer procedures.

---

## 9. Monitoring, Logging, and Privacy Notice

☐ I acknowledge that systems may be monitored and that user activity may be logged for security, compliance, and incident response purposes.  
☐ I consent to such monitoring as a condition of account access.

---

## 10. Incident Reporting and Cooperation

☐ I will report suspected or confirmed incidents immediately, including:
- Loss/theft of an endpoint used to access the enclave
- Suspected malware, phishing, or unauthorized access
- Accidental disclosure or spillage of CUI

☐ I will cooperate with incident response activities, including providing requested details and preserving evidence (do not delete logs or files relevant to an incident).

---

## 11. Consequences of Violation

☐ I understand violations may result in:
- Immediate revocation of access
- Disciplinary action up to and including termination
- Contractual notification obligations and legal consequences where applicable
