## Signature & evidence record (enclave deployment)

Approval record is maintained via the Trust Codex Manual Governance workflow (per-document sign-off under C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-* or central app).

**What counts as the approval record** is the per-document sign-off artifact written under `C:\evidence`, which includes:
- attestor identity (name/title/org)
- timestamp (UTC)
- **document SHA-256 hash** (the exact version reviewed)
- **stored record location** (where the sign-off record is retained)

**Expected location (written by the manual app):**
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-225-signoff.json`
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-225-signoff.md`
