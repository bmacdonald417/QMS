# System & Information Integrity Policy - CMMC Level 2

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-24  
**Classification:** Internal Use  
**Compliance Framework:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced)  
**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2

**Applies to:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (FCI and CUI system)

---

## 1. Policy Statement

MacTech Solutions maintains system and information integrity controls to protect Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and system resources from malicious code, unauthorized changes, and vulnerabilities. This policy establishes requirements for malware protection, system patching, and vulnerability management.

This policy aligns with CMMC Level 2 requirements and NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All system components (application, database, infrastructure)
- All software dependencies and libraries
- All system updates and patches
- All vulnerability management activities

---

## 3. Malware Protection

### 3.1 Malware Protection (NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Section 3.14.2)

**Requirement:** Systems must be protected from malicious code.

**Implementation:**
- Malware protection is provided by the hosting provider (historical) cloud platform
- hosting environment (historical) includes malware protection and security scanning
- Application dependencies are managed via npm package manager
- No additional endpoint protection software is installed on application servers

**Inherited Controls:**
- hosting environment (historical) provides infrastructure-level malware protection
- Platform security includes automated threat detection
- Network-level protections against malicious traffic

**Status:** Inherited control from hosting environment (historical)

**Coverage:** All application and database infrastructure hosted on hosting provider (historical)

---

### 3.2 Application-Level Protections

**Input Validation:**
- All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM (parameterized queries)
- XSS risk mitigation via React framework output encoding
- Evidence: Input validation throughout application code

**Framework Protections:**
- Next.js framework features are implemented as described
- Framework-level protections are implemented. No additional CSRF controls are required for Level 1.
- Session management via NextAuth.js with token-based authentication

### 3.3 Endpoint Protection (SI.L1-3.14.2)

**Requirement:** Endpoints used to access/administer the system must have antivirus/endpoint protection enabled and verified.

**Implementation:**
- Endpoint inventory module tracks all endpoints used to access/administer the system
- Each endpoint entry includes:
  - Device identifier (hostname, serial number, etc.)
  - Owner name
  - Operating system
  - Antivirus enabled status (yes/no)
  - **Last verification date:** Required field documenting when AV status was last verified
  - **Verification method:** Required field documenting how verification was performed (e.g., "AV status check", "Defender screenshot", "EDR Dashboard", "Manual verification")
  - Notes field for additional information

**Verification Process:**
- Endpoint antivirus status is verified using the Endpoint AV Verification template (`05-evidence/templates/endpoint-av-verification-template.md`)
- Verification records document the verification method used (screenshot, EDR dashboard, Defender UI, etc.)
- Completed verification records are stored with evidence
- Endpoint inventory is updated with last verification date and verification method

**Evidence:**
- Endpoint inventory: `/admin/endpoint-inventory`
- Database: `EndpointInventory` table (includes `lastVerifiedDate` and `verificationMethod` fields)
- Endpoint AV Verification template: `05-evidence/templates/endpoint-av-verification-template.md`
- Endpoint Protection document: `06-supporting-documents/MAC-SEC-101_Endpoint_Protection.md`

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented** - Endpoint inventory module tracks endpoint AV status with verification evidence

**Infrastructure Patching:**
- hosting environment (historical) manages infrastructure patching
- Platform updates are managed by hosting environment (historical)
- No manual infrastructure patching required by organization

**Status:** Infrastructure patching is inherited from hosting environment (historical)

---

## Signature & evidence record (enclave deployment)

Approval record is maintained via the Trust Codex Manual Governance workflow (per-document sign-off under C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-* or central app).

**What counts as the approval record** is the per-document sign-off artifact written under `C:\evidence`, which includes:
- attestor identity (name/title/org)
- timestamp (UTC)
- **document SHA-256 hash** (the exact version reviewed)
- **stored record location** (where the sign-off record is retained)

**Expected location (written by the manual app):**
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-214-signoff.json`
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-POL-214-signoff.md`
