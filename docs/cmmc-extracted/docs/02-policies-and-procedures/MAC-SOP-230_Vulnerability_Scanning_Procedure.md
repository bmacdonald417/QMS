## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes the process for scanning organizational systems and applications for vulnerabilities and remediating identified vulnerabilities in accordance with risk assessments.

---

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
- Vulnerability scanning of organizational systems and applications
- Vulnerability remediation activities
- Vulnerability tracking and documentation

---

## 3. Vulnerability Scanning Process

### 3.1 Scanning Schedule

**Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Frequency: Weekly (automated via GitHub Dependabot)
- Schedule: Every Monday at 00:00 UTC
- Scope: All dependencies in `package.json`
- Method: Automated scanning via Dependabot
- Results: Dependabot pull requests and alerts
- Evidence: Dependabot configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Scanning Log: `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-114_Vulnerability_Scanning_Evidence.md`

**Application Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Frequency: Monthly minimum, as needed when new vulnerabilities identified
- Schedule: First Monday of each month
- Scope: Application code, configuration, deployment
- Method: Manual and automated tools (npm audit, manual review)
- Results: Documented in vulnerability remediation logs
- Scanning Log: `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-114_Vulnerability_Scanning_Evidence.md`

**Platform Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Frequency: Managed by hosting environment (historical) (inherited)
- Scope: Platform infrastructure
- Method: hosting environment (historical) scanning
- Results: Platform-managed

---

### 3.2 Scanning Execution

**Step 1: Automated Dependency Scanning**
- Dependabot automatically scans dependencies weekly
- Dependabot creates pull requests for security updates
- Dependabot alerts generated for vulnerabilities
- Review Dependabot results

**Step 2: Application Vulnerability Scanning**
- Conduct application vulnerability scanning as needed
- Use appropriate scanning tools
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Document scanning results

**Step 3: Review Scanning Results**
- Review all vulnerability scanning results
- Identify vulnerabilities requiring remediation
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment
- Document vulnerabilities in vulnerability log

---

## 4. Vulnerability Remediation Process

### 4.1 Vulnerability Prioritization

**Prioritization Factors:**
- Risk assessment results
- Vulnerability severity (CVSS score)
- Exploitability
- System criticality
- Business impact

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical:** Immediate action required (remediate within 7 days)
- **High:** Remediate within 30 days
- **Medium:** Remediate within 90 days
- **Low:** Remediate as resources permit

---

### 4.2 Remediation Execution

**Step 1: Develop Remediation Plan**
- Identify remediation approach
- Determine remediation timeline
- Assign responsible party
- Document remediation plan

**Step 2: Implement Remediation**
- Apply security patches or updates
- Implement configuration changes
- Deploy code fixes
- Test remediation implementation

**Step 3: Verify Remediation**
- Verify vulnerability is remediated
- Test system functionality
- Validate remediation effectiveness
- Document verification results

**Step 4: Document Remediation**
- Update vulnerability remediation log
- Document remediation actions taken
- Document verification results
- Update remediation status

---

### 4.3 Remediation Tracking

**Vulnerability Remediation Log:**
- Vulnerability identifier (CVE, CWE, etc.)
- Vulnerability description
- Discovery date
- Severity/priority
- Remediation plan
- Responsible party
- Target completion date
- Actual completion date
- Verification results
- Status (Open, In Progress, Remediated, Verified)

**Log Location:**
- `../05-evidence/vulnerability-remediation/recent-remediations.md`
- Vulnerability Remediation Evidence: `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-115_Vulnerability_Remediation_Evidence.md`

---

## 5. Vulnerability Remediation Timeline

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Remediate within 7 days
- Immediate action required
- Expedited remediation process

**High-Severity Vulnerabilities:**
- Remediate within 30 days
- Prioritized remediation
- Regular status updates

**Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities:**
- Remediate within 90 days
- Scheduled remediation
- Progress tracked

**Low-Severity Vulnerabilities:**
- Remediate as resources permit
- Lower priority
- Tracked in remediation log

---

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

**System Administrator:**
- Coordinate vulnerability scanning
- Manage vulnerability remediation
- Maintain vulnerability remediation log
- Track remediation progress

**Development Team:**
- Implement vulnerability remediations
- Test remediation implementations
- Verify remediation effectiveness

**Management:**
- Review vulnerability remediation status
- Allocate resources for remediation
- Approve remediation timelines

---

## 7. Vulnerability Sources

**Automated Scanning:**
- GitHub Dependabot (weekly dependency scanning)
- hosting environment (historical) scanning (inherited)

**Security Advisories:**
- CISA alerts and advisories
- NIST NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- Vendor security advisories
- Industry information sharing (ISACs)

**Other Sources:**
- Security assessments
- Incident response activities
- User reports
- Security research

## Signature & evidence record (enclave deployment)

Approval record is maintained via the Trust Codex Manual Governance workflow (per-document sign-off under C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-* or central app).

**What counts as the approval record** is the per-document sign-off artifact written under `C:\evidence`, which includes:
- attestor identity (name/title/org)
- timestamp (UTC)
- **document SHA-256 hash** (the exact version reviewed)
- **stored record location** (where the sign-off record is retained)

**Expected location (written by the manual app):**
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-SOP-230-signoff.json`
- `C:\evidence\CUI-Doc-Signoff-<RunId>\MAC-SOP-230-signoff.md`
