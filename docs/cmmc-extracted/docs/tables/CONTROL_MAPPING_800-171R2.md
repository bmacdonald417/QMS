# Explicit Control Mapping — NIST SP 800-171 Rev.2 (110 requirements)

This table explicitly maps **each** NIST SP 800-171 Rev.2 requirement to the pilot control strategy.

## How Rev.3 is used here (without changing scope)

- **Authoritative requirement set remains Rev.2** for CMMC 2.0 Level 2 mapping.
- NIST SP 800-171 Rev.3 is used **as an explanatory reference** (clarifies intent, introduces organization-defined parameters, and reduces ambiguity), but it is **not** treated as the controlling requirement set for this pilot.
