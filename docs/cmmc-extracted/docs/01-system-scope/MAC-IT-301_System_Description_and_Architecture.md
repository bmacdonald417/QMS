## 1. System Purpose

The MacTech Solutions system is a web-based federal contract opportunity management and capture platform. The system enables authorized personnel to discover, analyze, and manage federal contracting opportunities from SAM.gov and related government procurement sources.

**Primary Functions:**
- Discovery and ingestion of federal contract opportunities from SAM.gov
- Storage and analysis of Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- Contract opportunity scoring and relevance assessment
- Award history tracking via USAspending.gov integration
- Administrative portal for authorized users
- CUI file storage and password-protected access

## 2. Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Handling

### 2.1 Federal Contract Information (FCI)

Only non-public information related to government contracts is treated as FCI. Publicly released information (e.g., SAM.gov postings, USAspending.gov data) is not FCI unless combined with internal, non-public data.

The system handles:
- **Non-public contract opportunity data** received, generated, or stored internally
- **Internal analysis and annotations** related to contract opportunities
- **User-generated content** that combines public data with internal, non-public information
- **Derived data** generated from internal processing of contract information

**Important:** Publicly available data from SAM.gov and USAspending.gov APIs is not FCI by itself. FCI exists only when such data is combined with internal, non-public information or when the system receives, generates, or stores non-public contract-related information.

**FCI and CUI Boundary:** See `MAC-SEC-302_FCI_and_CUI_Scope_and_Data_Boundary_Statement.md` for explicit FCI and CUI definition, prohibited data types, and data boundary enforcement.

### 2.2 Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

The system processes, stores, and manages Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as defined by 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry.

**CUI Handling:**
- CUI files are handled via a **direct-to-vault** model: the **CUI workspace browser (endpoint operating system VM)** uploads/downloads CUI bytes directly to/from the dedicated CUI vault.
- hosting provider (historical) stores **CUI metadata only** in `StoredCUIFile` (e.g., vaultId, size, mimeType, owner, timestamps) and enforces access control and audit logging.
- CUI keyword detection is used for spill prevention (to prevent misrouting CUI bytes to non-CUI endpoints).
- CUI access attempts are logged to the audit log.

**CUI Storage:**
- Primary CUI storage: Dedicated CUI vault infrastructure on cloud service provider (historical) (<vault-domain>)
- CUI vault provides isolated, encrypted storage for CUI records using AES-256-GCM encryption with FIPS-validated cryptography (CMVP Certificate #4794)
- **Vault Requirement:** CUI vault is required for all new CUI file uploads. If vault unavailable, upload is rejected (no fallback to hosting provider (historical) storage).
- Metadata and legacy files: managed database service (historical) `StoredCUIFile` table (for backward compatibility and file metadata only)
- **hosting provider (historical) Role:** hosting provider (historical) is outside the CUI security boundary. hosting provider (historical) functions as a transmission medium for routing CUI to vault, but does not store CUI content.
- No CUI stored on removable media
- CUI access controlled via authentication and vault token issuance (no hosting provider (historical) password verification)

**CUI Processing:**
- CUI uploads use a direct-to-vault flow. hosting provider (historical) issues short-lived tokens (metadata only); browser uploads bytes to vault.
- System auto-detects CUI keywords only to **block** CUI on `/api/files/upload` (no CUI bytes accepted on hosting provider (historical)).
- CUI files stored separately from FCI files (vault for bytes; hosting provider (historical) for metadata).
- CUI access requires authentication and vault-issued view tokens (no password verification on hosting provider (historical)).

### 2.3 FCI and CUI Storage

**FCI Storage:**
- All FCI is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on hosting provider (historical) cloud platform
- No FCI is stored on removable media
- Source code and system documentation are stored in GitHub repositories

**CUI Storage:**
- Primary CUI storage: Dedicated CUI vault infrastructure on cloud service provider (historical) (<vault-domain>)
- CUI vault provides isolated, encrypted storage for CUI records using AES-256-GCM encryption with FIPS-validated cryptography (CMVP Certificate #4794)
- **Vault Requirement:** CUI vault is required for all new CUI file uploads. If vault unavailable, upload is rejected (no fallback to hosting provider (historical) storage).
- Metadata and legacy files: managed database service (historical) `StoredCUIFile` table (for backward compatibility and file metadata only)
- **hosting provider (historical) Role:** hosting provider (historical) is outside the CUI security boundary. hosting provider (historical) terminates TLS for metadata and token issuance only, not for CUI bytes. CUI bytes flow directly between browser and vault.
- CUI access uses vault view tokens; hosting provider (historical) does not handle CUI bytes.
- No CUI stored on removable media

**FCI and CUI Processing:**
- FCI is ingested via automated processes from public government APIs (SAM.gov, USAspending.gov)
- CUI is uploaded by users via direct-to-vault flow (upload-session token from hosting provider (historical); bytes sent to vault)
- FCI and CUI are processed, analyzed, and stored for authorized user access
- All FCI and CUI access is restricted to authenticated users with appropriate authorization

## 7. Compliance Risks & Open Items

### 7.1 File Upload Storage
**Risk Description:** Uploaded files are currently stored locally within the application runtime in `/public/uploads/` directory. These files are limited to non-sensitive content and are not FCI.

**Mitigation:**
- No removable media is used for file storage
- Files are stored within the application runtime environment
- Future architectural changes may migrate uploads to managed cloud storage

**Status:** Acceptable for Level 1 compliance; enhancement opportunity for future architecture

### 7.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**Status:** MFA is not implemented. MFA is not required for CMMC Level 1 compliance but represents a security enhancement opportunity.

### 7.3 Audit Logging
**Status:** Formal audit logging system is not implemented. Application logs are available through hosting environment (historical) logging. Enhanced audit logging may be implemented as a future enhancement.

### 7.4 Non-Required Hardening Items (Out of Scope for Level 1)
The following items are not required for CMMC Level 1 but represent potential future enhancements:
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Explicit security headers configuration
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Cloud-based file storage migration
