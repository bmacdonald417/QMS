## Scope Declaration

**This System Security Plan (SSP) is the authoritative SSP for the CMMC 2.0 Level 2 CUI enclave. CMMC Level 1 (FCI-only) artifacts are maintained separately and are not assessed under this SSP.**

This document describes the security controls, implementation, and operational procedures for the MacTech Solutions Application as a CMMC 2.0 Level 2 system that processes, stores, and transmits Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as defined by 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry.

---

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 System Identification

**System Name:** MacTech Solutions Application  
**System Type:** Web Application  
**Hosting:** third-party hosting provider (historical)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (hosting provider (historical))  
**Source Control:** GitHub

### 1.2 System Purpose

The MacTech Solutions Application is a CMMC 2.0 Level 2 system that processes, stores, and manages Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as defined by 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry. The system processes proposals, Statements of Work (SOWs), contract documentation, and other information containing CUI per Level 2 requirements. CUI is handled according to established CUI handling procedures and security controls documented in this System Security Plan.

The system implements all 110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 security controls required for CMMC Level 2 compliance. Security controls are implemented internally (91 controls), inherited from service providers (6 controls), or documented as not applicable (10 controls). All controls are implemented - full compliance achieved. CUI is handled by FIPS-validated cryptography via Linux distribution (historical) cryptographic library Cryptographic Module (FIPS-validated cryptographic module (environment-specific)) operating in FIPS-approved mode.

### 1.3 Related Frameworks

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Alignment:** MacTech Solutions' cybersecurity program aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. This alignment is documented in the CSF 2.0 Profile (`../../nist-csf-2.0/`) and is based on the existing CMMC Level 2 implementation described in this System Security Plan. All six CSF 2.0 functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) are supported by existing NIST SP 800-171 controls implemented for CMMC Level 2 compliance. CMMC 2.0 Level 2 remains the primary compliance framework for DoD contracts.

**FedRAMP Moderate Design Alignment:** MacTech Solutions' security architecture and control design are aligned with the FedRAMP Moderate baseline. This alignment is documented in the FedRAMP Moderate Design Alignment Package (`../../fedramp-moderate-alignment/`) and is based on the existing CMMC Level 2 implementation described in this System Security Plan. All applicable FedRAMP Moderate control families are addressed through existing NIST SP 800-171 controls implemented for CMMC Level 2 compliance. CMMC 2.0 Level 2 remains the primary compliance framework for DoD contracts.

**SOC 2 Type I Readiness:** MacTech Solutions has completed an internal SOC 2 Type I readiness assessment. This readiness is documented in the SOC 2 Type I Readiness Package (`../../soc2-type1-readiness/`) and is based on the existing CMMC Level 2 implementation described in this System Security Plan. All 9 Common Criteria (CC1-CC9) are addressed through existing NIST SP 800-171 controls implemented for CMMC Level 2 compliance. CMMC 2.0 Level 2 remains the primary compliance framework for DoD contracts.

**NIST RMF Alignment:** MacTech Solutions aligns its system security governance with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). This alignment is documented in the RMF Alignment Package (`../../nist-rmf-alignment/`) and is based on the existing CMMC Level 2 implementation described in this System Security Plan. All six RMF steps (Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor) are addressed through existing security governance and control implementation. CMMC 2.0 Level 2 remains the primary compliance framework for DoD contracts.

**Network Segmentation (FAR 52.204-21(b)(1)(xi)):**
- hosting environment (historical) provides logical network separation between publicly accessible and internal components
- Public network segment: Next.js application (accepts HTTPS from internet)
- Internal network segment: PostgreSQL database (not directly accessible from internet)
- Network boundaries and access controls managed by hosting provider (historical) (inherited control)

### 2.4 CMMC Level 2 CUI Enclave Boundary Declaration

**Only the following components are in scope for CMMC Level 2 CUI handling:**

**In-Scope Components for CUI:**

1. **Next.js Application (hosting environment (historical))**
   - Application code that processes CUI files
   - CUI upload/view session endpoints (`/api/cui/upload-session`, `/api/cui/view-session`)
   - CUI keyword detection and classification logic (`lib/cui-blocker.ts`)
   - CUI access control middleware and authorization checks

2. **PostgreSQL Database - StoredCUIFile Table (hosting environment (historical))**
   - Database table for CUI file metadata, access control, and backward compatibility with legacy files
   - Primary CUI content storage is in dedicated CUI vault on cloud service provider (historical) (<vault-domain>)
   - Metadata stored in encrypted database (encryption at rest provided by hosting provider (historical) for metadata only, not CUI content)
   - Legacy CUI files may remain in this table for backward compatibility

3. **Authentication System (NextAuth.js)**
   - User authentication required for all CUI access
   - MFA enforcement for all users accessing CUI systems
   - Session management for authenticated CUI access

4. **CUI File Storage and Access Control**
   - CUI file storage functions (`lib/file-storage.ts`: `storeCUIFile`, `getCUIFile`)
   - CUI password protection mechanism
   - CUI access logging and audit controls

5. **CUI Access Control Middleware**
   - Role-based access control for CUI files
   - Authentication and authorization checks for CUI endpoints
   - CUI access attempt logging

6. **CUI Workspace (endpoint operating system Boundary VM)**
   - Dedicated endpoint operating system VM serves as the **primary CUI workspace** for users
   - Browser on this workstation performs direct-to-vault upload/view (CUI bytes traverse the workstation ↔ vault)
   - Workstation is enclave-managed (access controlled, monitored, and governed by policy/training)

**Explicitly Out-of-Scope Components for CUI:**

1. **FCI-Only Components**
   - `StoredFile` database table (for non-CUI files only)
   - FCI data processing and storage components
   - FCI-only API endpoints and functionality

2. **External Read-Only APIs**
   - SAM.gov API (read-only, public data, no CUI transmitted)
   - USAspending.gov API (read-only, public data, no CUI transmitted)

3. **Source Code Repository**
   - GitHub repository (no CUI stored in source code)
   - Source code version control and management

4. **Unmanaged User Endpoints (Outside CUI Boundary)**
   - Non-approved user browsers and client devices (unmanaged endpoints)
   - Non-enclave network connections and local processing/storage on unmanaged devices
   - **Note:** The dedicated endpoint operating system CUI workspace VM is explicitly **in-scope** (see above)

5. **hosting provider (historical) Infrastructure (Inherited, Not Assessed)**
   - hosting environment (historical) infrastructure components
   - hosting provider (historical)-managed network infrastructure
   - hosting environment (historical) security controls (documented as inherited controls)

**Boundary Enforcement:**
- This explicit boundary declaration prevents scope expansion to components not designed for CUI handling
- All CUI processing, storage, and transmission occurs only within the in-scope components listed above
- Components not listed above are explicitly excluded from CMMC Level 2 CUI assessment scope

### 2.5 CUI Prohibition and Technical Enforcement

**Explicit Prohibition Statement:**

CUI is **PROHIBITED** from being stored, processed, or transmitted in any component not explicitly listed in the "In-Scope Components for CUI" section above. The following components are explicitly prohibited from handling CUI:

1. **FCI-Only Components - PROHIBITED for CUI:**
   - `StoredFile` database table (for non-CUI files only) - CUI cannot be stored in this table
   - FCI data processing and storage components - CUI processing prohibited
   - FCI-only API endpoints and functionality - CUI transmission prohibited

2. **External Read-Only APIs - PROHIBITED for CUI:**
   - SAM.gov API - Read-only, public data only, no CUI transmission possible
   - USAspending.gov API - Read-only, public data only, no CUI transmission possible

3. **Source Code Repository - PROHIBITED for CUI:**
   - GitHub repository - Source code only, no CUI storage capability

4. **Unmanaged User Endpoints - PROHIBITED for CUI:**
   - Unmanaged user browsers and client devices are prohibited from receiving/storing CUI
   - CUI handling is restricted to the managed **endpoint operating system CUI workspace VM** and the **CUI vault**

5. **hosting provider (historical) Infrastructure - OUTSIDE CUI Security Boundary:**
   - hosting environment (historical) infrastructure components - Outside CUI security boundary
   - hosting provider (historical)-managed network infrastructure - Transmission medium only, not cryptographic boundary
   - **hosting provider (historical) Role:** hosting provider (historical) does NOT receive, decrypt, process, or store CUI file bytes. hosting provider (historical) hosts the UI, authenticates users, and issues short-lived tokens for vault upload/view. All CUI upload/download occurs directly between browser and FIPS vault.
   - **TLS:** hosting provider (historical) terminates TLS for metadata and token issuance only, not for CUI bytes. Endpoints such as `/api/cui/upload-session`, `/api/cui/view-session`, and `/api/cui/record` carry only metadata and tokens; CUI file bytes never flow to or from hosting provider (historical).
   - **CUI Transit:** CUI file bytes flow directly between browser and vault (TLS terminates on vault for CUI payloads). hosting provider (historical) does not perform cryptographic operations protecting CUI. All cryptographic operations protecting CUI are performed by FIPS-validated modules in the CUI Vault.
   - **CUI Storage:** hosting provider (historical) does NOT store CUI content. hosting provider (historical) database stores metadata only (fileId, vaultId, size, mimeType, owner, timestamps). All CUI content is stored in CUI vault (FIPS-validated storage).
   - **CUI Processing:** hosting provider (historical) does not process CUI bytes. hosting provider (historical) does not log CUI content; audit logs for CUI events use redacted identifiers (no raw filenames).

**Technical Enforcement Mechanisms:**

The following technical controls enforce CUI boundary restrictions and prevent CUI from being stored, processed, or transmitted outside designated components:

1. **Database-Level Enforcement:**
   - Primary CUI storage: Dedicated CUI vault on cloud service provider (historical) (<vault-domain>)
   - CUI metadata stored in `StoredCUIFile` table (separate from `StoredFile` table for FCI)
   - Database schema enforces separation: `StoredCUIFile` model is distinct from `StoredFile` model
   - Code cannot store CUI in FCI table - separate storage functions enforce routing
   - New CUI files are routed to CUI vault; hosting provider (historical) table stores metadata and legacy files
   - Evidence: `prisma/schema.prisma` (StoredCUIFile model separate from StoredFile model), `lib/cui-vault-client.ts` (CUI vault integration)

2. **Application-Level Enforcement:**
   - CUI upload: `/api/files/upload` rejects multipart CUI (400) with message to use direct-to-vault flow. Browser obtains upload token from `/api/cui/upload-session` (metadata only), uploads file directly to vault, then records metadata via `/api/cui/record`. hosting provider (historical) never receives CUI file bytes.
   - CUI view: Browser obtains view URL/token from `/api/cui/view-session` and opens vault URL directly. `/api/files/cui/[id]` returns view session only (no file bytes).
   - CUI delete: hosting provider (historical) calls vault DELETE first; only on success marks DB record deleted. On vault failure, DB is not updated and failure is logged (no filename).
   - CUI detection (`lib/cui-blocker.ts`) used only to reject CUI at `/api/files/upload`; no CUI bytes accepted on hosting provider (historical).
   - Evidence: `app/api/cui/upload-session/route.ts`, `app/api/cui/view-session/route.ts`, `app/api/cui/record/route.ts`, `app/api/files/upload/route.ts` (rejects CUI multipart), `lib/cui-vault-client.ts` (token issuance only; no byte APIs)

3. **Access Control Enforcement:**
   - CUI access requires authentication and role-based authorization. View session and delete require ownership or ADMIN.
   - CUI view: `/api/cui/view-session?id=...` returns vault URL + token; browser opens vault directly. `/api/files/[id]` returns 403 with message for CUI files.
   - CUI delete: `/api/files/cui/[id]` DELETE calls vault first; only on success marks DB deleted (failures logged without filename).
   - Evidence: `app/api/cui/upload-session/route.ts`, `app/api/cui/view-session/route.ts`, `app/api/cui/record/route.ts`, `app/api/files/cui/[id]/route.ts`, `lib/file-storage.ts` (getCUIFileMetadataForView, deleteCUIFile)

4. **Code Enforcement:**
   - `lib/file-storage.ts` enforces separate storage paths (cannot store CUI in FCI table)
   - Application logic prevents CUI from being routed to FCI storage functions
   - Type safety and function separation prevent accidental CUI storage in wrong location
   - Evidence: `lib/file-storage.ts` (separate storeCUIFile and storeFile functions)

5. **Audit Logging Enforcement:**
   - All CUI access attempts logged to audit system for monitoring
   - CUI file upload, access, and deletion events are logged
   - Audit logs enable detection of unauthorized CUI access attempts
   - Evidence: `lib/audit.ts` (CUI access event logging)

**Prohibition Enforcement by Component:**

1. **FCI-Only Components (`StoredFile` table):**
   - **Prohibition:** CUI cannot be stored in `StoredFile` table
   - **Technical Enforcement:** Direct-to-vault flow prevents CUI bytes from reaching hosting provider (historical); metadata-only routing prevents CUI from being stored in FCI table
   - **Evidence:** `lib/file-storage.ts` (separate storage functions), `app/api/files/upload/route.ts` (routing logic)

2. **External APIs (SAM.gov, USAspending.gov):**
   - **Prohibition:** CUI transmission to external APIs is prohibited
   - **Technical Enforcement:** APIs are read-only (outbound only), no CUI transmission possible
   - **Evidence:** API implementation (read-only access only)

3. **GitHub Repository:**
   - **Prohibition:** CUI storage in source code repository is prohibited
   - **Technical Enforcement:** Repository contains source code only, no CUI storage capability
   - **Evidence:** Repository structure (source code files only)

4. **Unmanaged User Endpoints (Browsers/Devices):**
   - **Prohibition:** CUI handling on unmanaged client devices is prohibited
   - **Enforcement:** Operational policy/training + access control ensures CUI workflows are performed from the managed endpoint operating system CUI workspace VM
   - **Evidence:** System boundary declaration and endpoint/workspace controls (see MAC-IT-105 and related evidence)

**Assessor-Friendly Statement:**

CUI is permitted **ONLY** in the following components: Next.js Application (CUI file processing), PostgreSQL `StoredCUIFile` table (CUI storage), Authentication System (CUI access control), CUI File Storage and Access Control functions, and CUI Access Control Middleware. CUI is **PROHIBITED** in all other components, and this prohibition is technically enforced through database schema separation, application-level routing, access control restrictions, code-level enforcement, and comprehensive audit logging as documented above.

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 FCI Data Flow

**Input:**
- Contract opportunities from SAM.gov API (read-only)
- User-entered data (opportunity analysis notes and tracking information - non-public data only)
- Note: File uploads are supported for non-CUI only; CUI bytes are handled via direct-to-vault flow (see Section 3.2).

**Processing:**
- Data stored in PostgreSQL database
- Application logic processes and displays FCI
- Admin functions manage FCI

**Output:**
- FCI displayed to authorized users
- CSV exports (admin-only)
- Reports and dashboards

**Storage:**
- All FCI stored in PostgreSQL database (encrypted at rest)
- No FCI stored on local devices
- No removable media used

### 3.2 CUI Data Flow

**Input:**
- Contract proposals, Statements of Work (SOWs), and contract documentation containing CUI
- User-entered CUI data
- CUI received from external sources per contract requirements

**Processing:**
- **CUI file bytes are never processed on hosting provider (historical).** hosting provider (historical) processes CUI metadata and access control decisions only.
- **CUI cryptographic processing occurs in the CUI Vault boundary** (upload encryption at rest; decrypt-and-stream for authorized access).
- Application logic issues short-lived vault tokens for authorized upload/view and records metadata after vault upload.

**Output:**
- CUI file bytes are displayed to authorized users only via direct browser-to-vault streaming (vault URL + short-lived token).
- Administrative exports that may contain CUI are restricted to authorized roles and protected by MFA and audit logging.

**Storage:**
- **Primary CUI storage (bytes):** CUI Vault (cloud service provider (historical) VM) stores CUI encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and serves CUI only over TLS 1.3.
- **hosting provider (historical) storage:** managed database service (historical) stores **CUI metadata only** (fileId, vaultId, size, mimeType, owner, timestamps). For vault-stored CUI, the `StoredCUIFile.data` field is empty (no bytes).
- **User endpoints:** Authorized user browsers/devices necessarily receive/transmit CUI bytes when uploading or viewing CUI. Endpoint requirements and user responsibilities are governed by policy and training; the system does not claim “no CUI bytes outside user endpoints.”
- CUI backups and media protections apply to the vault infrastructure and any authorized export workflows, per Media Handling Policy.

**Authoritative CUI Data Flow Diagram:**
The complete CUI data flow, including ingress, storage, processing, egress, and destruction points, is documented in the authoritative CUI Data Flow Diagram (`MAC-IT-305_CUI_Data_Flow_Diagram.md`). This diagram maps each flow point to specific security controls:

- **Ingress (3.1.3):** CUI file ingress for approved handling is via `POST /api/cui/upload-session` (metadata only) followed by direct browser upload to the vault `POST /v1/files/upload` (Bearer token). `POST /api/files/upload` is **non-CUI only** and rejects any attempt to send CUI bytes to hosting provider (historical).

- **Storage (3.8.2, 3.13.11):** CUI content is stored **EXCLUSIVELY** in the CUI vault on cloud service provider (historical) with FIPS-validated encryption. hosting provider (historical) database stores CUI metadata only (not CUI content). Control 3.8.2 (Limit access to CUI on system media) is implemented through CUI vault isolation and access controls. Control 3.13.11 (FIPS-validated cryptography) is implemented through CUI vault FIPS-validated encryption.

- **Processing (3.1.3, 3.8.2):** CUI access is controlled through token issuance, role-based authorization, and comprehensive audit logging (no CUI bytes on hosting provider (historical)). Controls 3.1.3 and 3.8.2 are enforced at the application logic layer.

- **Egress (3.1.3, 3.13.11):** CUI exits the system via vault URL/token issuance (`/api/cui/view-session`) and direct vault HTTPS/TLS streaming. Control 3.1.3 implements controlled CUI flow, and Control 3.13.11 implements encrypted transmission.

- **Destruction (3.8.2):** CUI deletion is performed vault-first (delete encrypted record in vault) followed by metadata logical deletion in hosting provider (historical). Media handling and backup protections apply to vault storage per the Media Handling Policy.

All CUI data flow points are protected by MFA (3.5.3), user identification (3.5.1), and audit logging (3.3.1). Evidence of implementation is documented in the CUI Blocking Technical Controls Evidence (`../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-101_CUI_Blocking_Technical_Controls_Evidence.md`) and related control evidence documents.

### 3.3 Authentication Flow

1. User accesses application
2. Unauthenticated users redirected to `/auth/signin`
3. User provides email and password
4. System validates credentials (bcrypt)
5. MFA required for all authenticated sessions (Level 2)
6. Session token created (JWT) and access is gated until MFA verification is completed
7. User accesses protected resources (including CUI token issuance and metadata APIs)
8. Session expires after 8 hours (or per configured policy)

## 4. System Interconnections and External Dependencies

### 4.1 External System Connections

The system connects to the following external systems:

| External System | Connection Type | Purpose | Data Flow | Security Controls | Connection Method |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SAM.gov API** | HTTPS/TLS (read-only) | Retrieve public contract opportunity data | Outbound only | TLS encryption (inherited from hosting provider (historical)), read-only access | REST API calls |
| **USAspending.gov API** | HTTPS/TLS (read-only) | Retrieve public award history data | Outbound only | TLS encryption (inherited from hosting provider (historical)), read-only access | REST API calls |
| **hosting environment (historical)** | HTTPS/TLS, Encrypted database connection | Application hosting, database hosting, CI/CD | Bidirectional | TLS encryption, database encryption at rest for metadata only (inherited controls - CUI content stored in separate CUI vault) | Platform service integration |
| **GitHub.com** | HTTPS/TLS | Source code repository, dependency scanning | Bidirectional | TLS encryption, repository access controls (inherited controls) | Git operations, API calls |

### 4.2 Connection Security Controls

**Network Encryption:**
- All external connections use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- TLS provided by hosting environment (historical) (inherited control)
- Database connections encrypted (hosting provider (historical)-managed)

**Access Controls:**
- External API access: Read-only, no authentication required (public APIs)
- GitHub repository access: Controlled via GitHub authentication and authorization
- hosting environment (historical) access: Controlled via hosting provider (historical) authentication

**System Boundaries:**
- System boundaries are defined at the hosting provider's managed network edge.
- The contractor does not manage firewalls, routers, or network boundary devices.
- Boundary protection is inherited from the platform-as-a-service environment.

**Connection Monitoring:**
- Application logs available through hosting environment (historical)
- API call errors logged in application logs
- Connection failures monitored via hosting environment (historical)

### 4.3 Data Flow for External Systems

**SAM.gov API:**
- System initiates HTTPS connection to SAM.gov API
- Retrieves public contract opportunity data
- Data processed and stored in PostgreSQL database
- No FCI transmitted to SAM.gov (read-only, public data)

**USAspending.gov API:**
- System initiates HTTPS connection to USAspending.gov API
- Retrieves public award history data
- Data processed and stored in PostgreSQL database
- No FCI transmitted to USAspending.gov (read-only, public data)

**GitHub.com:**
- Source code push/pull operations via Git over HTTPS
- Dependabot automated scanning (weekly)
- Security advisories and dependency alerts
- No FCI stored in source code repository

**hosting environment (historical):**
- Application deployment via hosting environment (historical)
- Database hosting via managed database service (historical) service
- CI/CD integration for automated deployments
- All data transmission encrypted

### 4.5 CUI File Handling Procedures

**CUI File Storage:**
- **Primary CUI storage (bytes):** CUI file bytes are stored in the dedicated CUI Vault (<vault-domain>) encrypted at rest.
- **hosting provider (historical) storage:** managed database service (historical) stores **CUI metadata only** in the `StoredCUIFile` table (e.g., `vaultId`, size, mimeType, ownership, timestamps). Vault-stored records contain no file bytes on hosting provider (historical).
- CUI metadata records are segregated from FCI/non-CUI file records (`StoredFile`) for clear boundary enforcement and access control.

**CUI File Upload:**
- Approved CUI upload uses a **direct-to-vault** flow:
  - Client requests an upload session from hosting provider (historical) (`POST /api/cui/upload-session`) with metadata only.
  - **CUI workspace browser (endpoint operating system VM)** uploads CUI file bytes directly to the vault (`POST /v1/files/upload`) using the short-lived token.
  - Client records vault metadata back to hosting provider (historical) (`POST /api/cui/record`) so hosting provider (historical) can manage access control and audit logging.
- Any attempt to send CUI bytes to the non-CUI upload endpoint (`POST /api/files/upload`) is rejected and treated as a spill attempt.
